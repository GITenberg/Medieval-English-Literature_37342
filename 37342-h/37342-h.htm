<br />INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>Readers are drawn to medieval literature in many
different ways, and it is hardly possible to describe all
the attractions and all the approaches by which they
enter on this ground. Students of history have to
learn the languages of the nations with whose history
they are concerned, and to read the chief books in
those languages, if they wish to understand rightly the
ideas, purposes and temper of the past ages. Sometimes
the study of early literature has been instigated
by religious or controversial motives, as when the
Anglo-Saxon homilies were taken up and edited and
interpreted in support of the Reformation. Sometimes
it is mere curiosity that leads to investigation of
old literature&mdash;a wish to find out the meaning of what
looks at first difficult and mysterious. Curiosity of
this sort, however, is seldom found unmixed; there
are generally all sorts of vague associations and interests
combining to lead the explorer on. It has often been
observed that a love of Gothic architecture, or of
medieval art in general, goes along with, and helps,
the study of medieval poetry. Chatterton&rsquo;s old
English reading and his imitations of old English verse
were inspired by the Church of St. Mary Redcliffe at
Bristol. The lives of Horace Walpole, of Thomas
Warton, of Sir Walter Scott, and many others show
how medieval literary studies may be nourished along
with other kindred antiquarian tastes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">[8]</div>
<p>Sometimes, instead of beginning in historical or
antiquarian interests, or in a liking for the fashions
of the Middle Ages in general, it happens that a love
of medieval literature has its rise in one particular
author, e.g. Dante or Sir Thomas Malory. The book,
the <i>Divina Commedia</i> or <i>Le Morte d&rsquo;Arthur</i>, is taken
up, it may be, casually, with no very distinct idea or
purpose, and then it is found to be engrossing and
captivating&mdash;what is often rightly called &lsquo;a revelation
of a new world&rsquo;. For a long time this is enough in
itself; the reader is content with Dante or with the
<i>Morte d&rsquo;Arthur</i>. But it may occur to him to ask
about &lsquo;the French book&rsquo; from which Malory got his
adventures of the Knights of King Arthur; he may
want to know how the legend of the Grail came to be
mixed up with the romances of the Round Table; and
so he will be drawn on, trying to find out as much
as possible and plunging deeper and deeper into the
Middle Ages. The same kind of thing happens to
the reader of Dante; Dante is found all through his
poem acknowledging obligations to earlier writers; he
is not alone or independent in his thought and his
poetry; and so it becomes an interesting thing to go
further back and to know something about the older
poets and moralists, and the earlier medieval world in
general, before it was all summed up and recorded
in the imagination of the Divine Comedy. Examples
of this way of reading may be found in the works of
Ruskin and in Matthew Arnold. Matthew Arnold,
rather late in his life (in the introductory essay to
T. H. Ward&rsquo;s <i>English Poets</i>), shows that he has
been reading some old French authors. He does not
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
begin with old French when he is young; evidently
he was brought to it in working back from the better
known poets, Dante and Chaucer. Ruskin&rsquo;s old
French quotations are also rather late in the series of
his writings; it was in his Oxford lectures, partly
published in <i>Fors Clavigera</i>, that he dealt with <i>The
Romance of the Rose</i>, and used it to illustrate whatever
else was in his mind at the time.</p>
<p>Thus it is obvious that any one who sets out to write
about English literature in the Middle Ages will find
himself addressing an audience which is not at all in
agreement with regard to the subject. Some will
probably be historical in their tastes, and will seek, in
literature, for information about manners and customs,
fashions of opinion, &lsquo;typical developments&rsquo; in the
history of culture or education. Others may be on
the look-out for stories, for the charm of romance
which is sometimes thought to belong peculiarly to
the Middle Ages, and some, with ambitions of their
own, may ask for themes that can be used and adapted
in modern forms, as the Nibelung story has been used
by Wagner and William Morris and many others;
perhaps for mere suggestions of plots and scenery,
to be employed more freely, as in Morris&rsquo;s prose
romances, for example. Others, starting from one
favourite author&mdash;Dante or Chaucer or Malory&mdash;will
try to place what they already know in its right relation
to all its surroundings&mdash;by working, for instance, at
the history of religious poetry, or the different kinds
of story-telling. It is not easy to write for all these
and for other different tastes as well. But it is not a
hopeless business, so long as there is some sort of
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
interest to begin with, even if it be only a general
vague curiosity about an unknown subject.</p>
<p>There are many prejudices against the Middle Ages;
the name itself was originally an expression of contempt;
it means the interval of darkness between the
ruin of ancient classical culture and the modern revival
of learning&mdash;a time supposed to be full of ignorance,
superstition and bad taste, an object of loathing to
well-educated persons. As an example of this sort of
opinion about the Middle Ages, one may take what
Bentham says of our &lsquo;barbarian ancestors&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;few of
whom could so much as read, and those few had
nothing before them that was worth the reading&rsquo;.
&lsquo;When from their ordinary occupation, their order of
the day, the cutting of one another&rsquo;s throats, or those
of Welshmen, Scotchmen or Irishmen, they could
steal now and then a holiday, how did they employ it?
In cutting Frenchmen&rsquo;s throats in order to get their
money: this was active virtue:&mdash;leaving Frenchmen&rsquo;s
throats uncut was indolence, slumber, inglorious ease.&rsquo;</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Middle Ages have been
glorified by many writers; &lsquo;the Age of Chivalry&rsquo;, the
&lsquo;Ages of Faith&rsquo; have often been contrasted with the
hardness of the age of enlightenment, rationalism, and
material progress; they are thought of as full of colour,
variety, romance of all sorts, while modern civilization
is represented as comparatively dull, monotonous and
unpicturesque. This kind of view has so far prevailed,
even among people who do not go to any extremes, and
who are not excessively enthusiastic or romantic, that
the term &lsquo;Gothic&rsquo;, which used to be a term of contempt
for the Middle Ages, has entirely lost its scornful
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
associations. &lsquo;Gothic&rsquo; was originally an abusive
name, like &lsquo;Vandalism&rsquo;; it meant the same thing as
&lsquo;barbarian&rsquo;. But while &lsquo;Vandalism&rsquo; has kept its bad
meaning, &lsquo;Gothic&rsquo; has lost it. It does not now mean
&lsquo;barbarous&rsquo;, and if it still means &lsquo;unclassical&rsquo; it does
not imply that what is &lsquo;unclassical&rsquo; must be wrong.
It is possible now to think of the Middle Ages and
their literature without prejudice on the one side or
the other. As no one now thinks of despising Gothic
architecture simply because it is not Greek, so the
books of the Middle Ages may be read in a spirit of
fairness by those who will take the trouble to understand
their language; they may be appreciated for
what they really are; their goodness or badness is
not now determined merely by comparison with the
work of other times in which the standards and ideals
of excellence were not the same.</p>
<p>The language is a difficulty. The older English
books are written in the language which is commonly
called Anglo-Saxon; this is certainly not one of the
most difficult, but no language is really easy to learn.
Anglo-Saxon poetry, besides, has a peculiar vocabulary
and strange forms of expression. The poetical
books are not to be read without a great deal of
application; they cannot be rushed.</p>
<p>Later, when the language has changed into what is
technically called Middle English&mdash;say, in the thirteenth
century&mdash;things are in many ways no better.
It is true that the language is nearer to modern English;
it is true also that the language of the poetical books is
generally much simpler and nearer that of ordinary
prose than was the language of the Anglo-Saxon poets.
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
But on the other hand, while Anglo-Saxon literature is
practically all in one language, Middle English is really
not a language at all, but a great number of different
tongues, belonging to different parts of the country.
And not only does the language of Yorkshire differ
from that of Kent, or Dorset, or London, or Lancashire,
but within the same district each author spells as he
pleases, and the man who makes a copy of his book
also spells as he pleases, and mixes up his own local
and personal varieties with those of the original author.
There is besides an enormously greater amount of
written matter extant in Middle English than in Anglo-Saxon,
and this, coming from all parts of the country,
is full of all varieties of odd words. The vocabulary
of Middle English, with its many French and Danish
words, its many words belonging to one region and
not to another, is, in some ways, more difficult than
that of Anglo-Saxon.</p>
<p>But luckily it is not hard, in spite of all these
hindrances, to make a fair beginning with the old
languages&mdash;in Anglo-Saxon, for example, with Sweet&rsquo;s
<i>Primer</i> and <i>Reader</i>, in Middle English with Chaucer
or <i>Piers Plowman</i>.</p>
<p>The difference in language between Anglo-Saxon
and Middle English corresponds to a division in the
history of literature. Anglo-Saxon literature is different
from that which follows it, not merely in its
grammar and dictionary, but in many of its ideas and
fashions, particularly in its fashion of poetry. The
difference may be expressed in this way, that while the
older English literature is mainly English, the literature
after the eleventh century is largely dependent on
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
France; France from 1100 to 1400 is the chief source
of ideas, culture, imagination, stories, and forms of
verse. It is sometimes thought that this was the
result of the Norman Conquest, but that is not the
proper explanation of what happened, either in
language or in literature. For the same kind of thing
happened in other countries which were not conquered
by the Normans or by any other people speaking
French. The history of the German language and of
German literature in the Middle Ages corresponds in
many things to the history of English. The name
Middle English was invented by a German philologist
(Grimm), who found in English the same stages of
development as in German; Anglo-Saxon corresponds
to Old German in its inflexions; Middle English is like
Middle German. The change, in both languages, is a
change from one kind of inflexion to another. In the
&lsquo;Old&rsquo; stage (say, about the year 900) the inflexions
have various clearly pronounced vowels in them;
in the &lsquo;Middle&rsquo; stage (about 1200) the terminations of
words have come to be pronounced less distinctly,
and where there is inflexion it shows most commonly
one vowel, written <i>e</i>, where the &lsquo;Old&rsquo; form might
have <i>a</i> or <i>o</i> or <i>u</i>. Changes of this kind had begun in
England before the Norman Conquest, and would
have gone on as they did in Germany if there had been
no Norman Conquest at all. The French and the
French language had nothing to do with it.</p>
<p>Where the French were really important was in their
ideas and in the forms of their poetry; they made
their influence felt through these in all Western
Christendom, in Italy, in Denmark, and even more
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
strongly in Germany than in England. Indeed it
might be said that the Norman Conquest made it less
easy for the English than it was for the Germans to
employ the French ideas when they were writing
books of their own in their own language. The
French influence was too strong in England; the
native language was discouraged; many Englishmen
wrote their books in French, instead of making English
adaptations from the French. The Germans, who
were independent politically, were not tempted in
the same way as the English, and in many respects
they were more successful than the English as translators
from the French, as adapters of French &lsquo;motives&rsquo;
and ideas. But whatever the differences might be
between one nation and another, it is certain that after
1100 French ideas were appreciated in all the countries
of Europe, in such a way as to make France the
principal source of enlightenment and entertainment
everywhere; and the intellectual predominance of
France is what most of all distinguishes the later
medieval from the earlier, that is, from the Anglo-Saxon
period, in the history of English literature.</p>
<p>The leadership of France in the literature of Europe
may be dated as beginning about 1100, which is the
time of the First Crusade and of many great changes
in the life of Christendom. About 1100 there is an
end of one great historical period, which began with
what is called the Wandering of the German nations,
and their settlement in various parts of the world.
The Norman Conquest of England, it has been said,
is the last of the movements in the wandering of the
nations. Goths and Vandals, Franks, Burgundians,
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
Lombards, Angles, Jutes and Saxons, Danes and
Northmen, had all had their times of adventure,
exploration, conquest and settlement. One great
event in this wandering was the establishment of the
Norwegian settlers in France, the foundation of
Normandy; and the expeditions of the Normans&mdash;to
Italy as well as to England&mdash;were nearly the last which
were conducted in the old style. After the Norman
Conquest there are new sorts of adventure, which are
represented in Chaucer&rsquo;s Knight and Squire&mdash;the one
a Crusader, or Knight errant, the other (his son)
engaged in a more modern sort of warfare, England
against France, nation against nation.</p>
<p>The two forms of the English language, Anglo-Saxon
and Middle English, and the two periods of
medieval English literature, correspond to the two
historical periods of which one ends and the other
begins about 1100, at the date of the First Crusade.
Anglo-Saxon literature belongs to the older world;
Anglo-Saxon poetry goes back to very early times and
keeps a tradition which had come down from ancient
days when the English were still a Continental German
tribe. Middle English literature is cut off from Anglo-Saxon,
the Anglo-Saxon stories are forgotten, and
though the old alliterative verse is kept, as late as the
sixteenth century, it is in a new form with a new tune
in it; while instead of being the one great instrument
of poetry it has to compete with rhyming couplets and
stanzas of different measure; it is hard put to it by
the rhymes of France.</p>

<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">CHAPTER II</span>
<br />THE ANGLO-SAXON PERIOD</h2>
<p>In dealing with Anglo-Saxon literature it is well to
remember first of all that comparatively little of it
has been preserved; we cannot be sure, either, that
the best things have been preserved, in the poetry
especially. Anglo-Saxon poetry was being made, we
know, for at least five hundred years. What now
exists is found, chiefly, in four manuscript volumes,<sup><a id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a></sup>
which have been saved, more or less accidentally,
from all sorts of dangers. No one can say what has
been lost. Many manuscripts, as good as any of
these, may have been sold as old parchment, or given
to the children to cut up into tails for kites. One
Anglo-Saxon poem, <i>Waldere</i>, is known from two
fragments of it which were discovered in the binding
of a book in Copenhagen. Two other poems were
fortunately copied and published about two hundred
years ago by two famous antiquaries; the original
manuscripts have disappeared since then. Who can
tell how many manuscripts have disappeared without
being copied? The obvious conclusion is that we can
speak about what we know, but not as if we knew
everything about Anglo-Saxon poetry.</p>
<p>With the prose it is rather different. The prose
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
translations due to King Alfred are preserved; so is
the English Chronicle; so are a fair number of religious
works, the homilies of &AElig;lfric and others; it does not
seem likely from what we know of the conditions of
authorship in those times that any prose work of any
notable or original value has disappeared. With the
poetry, on the other hand, every fresh discovery&mdash;like
that of the bookbinding fragments already mentioned&mdash;makes
one feel that the extent of Anglo-Saxon poetry
is unknown. Anything may turn up. We cannot say
what subjects were not treated by Anglo-Saxon poets.
It is certain that many good stories were known to
them which are not found in any of the extant
manuscripts.</p>
<p>The contents of Anglo-Saxon literature may be
divided into two sections, one belonging to the English
as a Teutonic people who inherited along with their
language a form of poetry and a number of stories
which have nothing to do with Roman civilization;
the other derived from Latin and turning into English
the knowledge which was common to the whole of
Europe.</p>
<p>The English in the beginning&mdash;Angles and Saxons&mdash;were
heathen Germans who took part in the great
movement called the Wandering of the Nations&mdash;who
left their homes and emigrated to lands belonging to
the Roman empire, and made slaves of the people they
found there. They were barbarians; the civilized
inhabitants of Britain, when the English appeared
there, thought of them as horrible savages. They were
as bad and detestable as the Red Indians were to the
Colonists in America long afterwards.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<p>But we know that the early English are not to be
judged entirely by the popular opinion of the Britons
whom they harried and enslaved, any more than the
English of Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s time are to be thought
of simply according to the Spanish ideas about Sir
Francis Drake. There were centuries of an old
civilization behind them when they settled in Britain;
what it was like is shown partially in the work of the
Bronze and the early Iron Age in the countries from
which the English came. The <i>Germania</i> of Tacitus
tells more, and more still is to be learned from the
remains of the old poetry.</p>
<p>Tacitus was not quite impartial in his account of
the Germans; he used them as examples to point a
moral against the vices of Rome; the German, in his
account, is something like the &lsquo;noble savage&rsquo; who was
idealized by later philosophers in order to chastise the
faults of sophisticated modern life. But Tacitus,
though he might have been rather inclined to favour
the Germans, was mainly a scientific observer who
wished to find out the truth about them, and to write
a clear description of their manners and customs. One
of the proofs of his success is the agreement between
his <i>Germania</i> and the pictures of life composed by the
people of that race themselves in their epic poetry.</p>
<p>The case of the early English is very like that of
the Danes and Northmen four or five hundred years
later. The Anglo-Saxons thought and wrote of the
Danes almost exactly as the Britons had thought of
their Saxon enemies. The English had to suffer from
the Danish pirates what the Britons had suffered from
the English; they cursed the Danes as their own
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
ancestors had been cursed by the Britons; the invaders
were utterly detestable and fiendish men of blood.
But luckily we have some other information about
those pirates. From the Norwegian, Danish and
Icelandic historians, and from some parts of the old
Northern poetry, there may be formed a different idea
about the character and domestic manners of the men
who made themselves so unpleasant in their visits to
the English and the neighbouring coasts. The pirates
at home were peaceful country gentlemen, leading
respectable and beneficent lives among their poorer
neighbours. The Icelandic histories&mdash;including the
history of Norway for three or four centuries&mdash;may be
consulted for the domestic life of the people who made
so bad a name for themselves as plunderers abroad.
They appear there, several varieties of them, as members
of a reasonable, honourable community, which
could have given many lessons of civilization to England
or France many centuries later. But the strangest and
most convincing evidence about the domestic manners
of the Northmen is found in English, and is written
by King Alfred himself. King Alfred had many
foreigners in his service, and one of them was a
Norwegian gentleman from the far North, named
Ohthere (or Ott&aacute;rr, as it would be in the Norse tongue
rather later than King Alfred&rsquo;s time). How he came
into the King&rsquo;s service is not known, but there are
other accounts of similar cases which show how easy
it was for Northmen of ability to make their way in
the world through the patronage of kings. Ohthere
belonged exactly to the class from which the most
daring and successful rovers came. He was a gentleman
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
of good position at home in Halogaland (now
called Helgeland in the north of Norway), a landowner
with various interests, attending to his crops, making a
good deal out of trade with the Finns and Lapps; and
besides that a navigator, the first who rounded the
North Cape and sailed into the White Sea. His
narrative, which is given by Alfred as an addition to
his translation of Orosius, makes a pleasant and amusing
contrast to the history of the Danish wars, which
also may have been partly written by King Alfred
himself for their proper place in the English Chronicle.</p>
<p>As the Icelandic sagas and Ohthere&rsquo;s narrative and
other documents make it easy to correct the prejudiced
and partial opinions of the English about the Danes,
so the opinions of the Britons about the Saxons are
corrected, though the evidence is not by any means so
clear. The Angles and Saxons, like the Danes and
Northmen later&mdash;like Sir Francis Drake, or like
Ulysses, we might say&mdash;were occasionally pirates, but
not restricted to that profession. They had many
other things to do and think about. Before everything,
they belonged to the great national system which
Tacitus calls <i>Germania</i>&mdash;which was never politically
united, even in the loosest way, but which nevertheless
was a unity, conscious of its separation from all the
foreigners whom it called, in a comprehensive manner,
Welsh. In England the Welsh are the Cambro-Britons;
in Germany Welsh means sometimes French,
sometimes Italian&mdash;a meaning preserved in the name
&lsquo;walnut&rsquo; (or &lsquo;walsh-note&rsquo;, as it is in Chaucer)&mdash;the
&lsquo;Italian nut&rsquo;. Those who are not Welsh are &lsquo;Teutonic&rsquo;&mdash;which
is not a mere modern pedantic name, but is
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
used by old writers in the same way as by modern
philologists, and applied to High or Low Dutch indifferently,
and also to English. But the unity of
<i>Germania</i>&mdash;the community of sentiment among the
early German nations&mdash;does not need to be proved by
such philological notes as the opposition of &lsquo;Dutch&rsquo;
and &lsquo;Welsh&rsquo;. It is proved by its own most valuable
results, by its own &lsquo;poetical works&rsquo;&mdash;the heroic legends
which were held in common by all the nations of
<i>Germania</i>. If any one were to ask, &lsquo;What does the old
English literature <i>prove</i>?&rsquo; the answer would be ready
enough. It proves that the Germanic nations had a
reciprocal free trade in subjects for epic poems. They
were generally free from local jealousy about heroes.
Instead of a natural rivalry among Goths, Burgundians
and the rest, the early poets seem to have had a liking
for heroes not of their own nation, so long as they were
members of one of the German tribes. (The Huns,
it may be here remarked, are counted as Germans;
Attila is not thought of as a barbarian.) The great
example of this common right in heroes is Sigfred,
Sigurd the Volsung, Siegfried of the <i>Nibelungenlied</i>.
His original stock and race is of no particular interest
to any one; he is a hero everywhere, and everywhere
he is thought of as belonging, in some way or other,
to the people who sing about him. This glory of
Sigurd or Siegfried is different from the later popularity
of King Arthur or of Charlemagne in countries outside
of Britain or France. Arthur and Charlemagne are
adopted in many places as favourite heroes without
any particular thought of their nationality, in much
the same way as Alexander the Great was celebrated
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
everywhere from pure love of adventurous stories. But
Siegfried or Sigurd, whether in High or Low Germany,
or Norway or Iceland, is always at home. He is not
indeed a national champion, like the Cid in Spain or
the Wallace in Scotland, but everywhere he is thought
of, apart from any local attachment, as the hero of the
race.</p>
<p>One of the old English poems called <i>Widsith</i> (the
Far Traveller) is an epitome of the heroic poetry of
<i>Germania</i>, and a clear proof of the common interest
taken in all the heroes. The theme of the poem is
the wandering of a poet, who makes his way to the
courts of the most famous kings: Ermanaric the Goth,
Gundahari the Burgundian, Alboin the Lombard, and
many more. The poem is a kind of <i>fantasia</i>, intended
to call up, by allusion, the personages of the most
famous stories; it is not an epic poem, but it plays with
some of the plots of heroic poetry familiar throughout
the whole Teutonic region. Ermanaric and
Gundahari, here called Eormanric and Guthhere, are
renowned in the old Scandinavian poetry, and the old
High German. Guthhere is one of the personages in
the poem of <i>Waldere</i>; what is Guthhere in English is
Gunnar in Norse, Gunther in German&mdash;the Gunther
of the <i>Nibelungenlied</i>. Offa comes into Widsith&rsquo;s
record, an English king; but he has no particular
mark or eminence or attraction to distinguish him in
the poet&rsquo;s favour from the Goth or the Lombard;
he is king of &lsquo;Ongle&rsquo;, the original Anglia to the south
of Jutland, and there is no room for doubt that the
English when they lived there and when they invaded
Britain had the stories of all the Teutonic heroes at
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
their command to occupy their minds, if they chose to
listen to the lay of the minstrel. What they got from
their minstrels was a number of stories about all the
famous men of the Teutonic race&mdash;stories chanted in
rhythmical verse and noble diction, presenting tragic
themes and pointing the moral of heroism.</p>
<p>Of this old poetry there remains one work nearly
complete. <i>Beowulf</i>, because it is extant, has sometimes
been over-valued, as if it were the work of an
English Homer. But it was not preserved as the <i>Iliad</i>
was, by the unanimous judgement of all the people
through successive generations. It must have been
of some importance at one time, or it would not have
been copied out fair as a handsome book for the library
of some gentleman. But many trashy things have
been equally honoured in gentlemen&rsquo;s libraries, and it
cannot be shown that <i>Beowulf</i> was nearly the best of
its class. It was preserved by an accident; it has no
right to the place of the most illustrious Anglo-Saxon
epic poem. The story is commonplace and the plan
is feeble. But there are some qualities in it which
make it (accidentally or not, it hardly matters) the
best worth studying of all the Anglo-Saxon poems.
It is the largest extant piece in any old Teutonic
language dealing poetically with native Teutonic
subjects. It is the largest and fullest picture of life
in the order to which it belongs; the only thing that
shows incontestably the power of the old heroic poetry
to deal on a fairly large scale with subjects taken from
the national tradition. The impression left by <i>Beowulf</i>,
when the carping critic has done his worst, is that of a
noble manner of life, of courtesy and freedom, with
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
the dignity of tragedy attending it, even though the
poet fails, or does not attempt, to work out fully any
proper tragic theme of his own.</p>
<p>There is a very curious likeness in many details
between <i>Beowulf</i> and the <i>Odyssey</i>; but quite apart
from the details there is a real likeness between them
in their &lsquo;criticism of life&lsquo;&mdash;i.e. in their exhibition of
human motives and their implied or expressed opinions
about human conduct. There is the same likeness
between the <i>Odyssey</i> and the best of the Icelandic
Sagas&mdash;particularly the <i>Story of Burnt Njal</i>; and the
lasting virtue of <i>Beowulf</i> is that it is bred in the same
sort of world as theirs. It is not so much the valour
and devotion of the hero; it is the conversation of the
hosts and guests in the King&rsquo;s hall, the play of serious
and gentle moods in the minds of the freeborn, that
gives its character to the poem. <i>Beowulf</i>, through its
rendering of noble manners, its picture of good society,
adds something distinct and unforgettable to the
records of the past. There is life in it, and a sort of
life which would be impossible without centuries of
training, of what Spenser called &lsquo;vertuous and gentle
discipline&rsquo;.</p>
<p><i>Beowulf</i> is worth studying, among other reasons,
because it brings out one great difference between the
earlier and later medieval poetry, between Anglo-Saxon
and Middle English taste in fiction. <i>Beowulf</i> is
a tale of adventure; the incidents in it are such as may
be found in hundreds of other stories. Beowulf himself,
the hero, is a champion and a slayer of monsters.
He hears that the King of the Danes is plagued in his
house by the visits of an ogre, who night after night
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
comes and carries off one of the King&rsquo;s men. He goes
on a visit to Denmark, sits up for the ogre, fights with
him and mortally wounds him. That does not end
the business, for the ogre&rsquo;s mother comes to revenge
her son, and Beowulf has a second fight and kills her
too, and is thanked and goes home again. Many years
afterwards when he is king in his own country, Gautland
(which is part of modern Sweden), a fiery dragon
is accidentally stirred up from a long sleep and makes
itself a pest to the country. Beowulf goes to attack
the dragon, fights and wins, but is himself killed by
the poison of the dragon. The poem ends with his
funeral. So told, in abstract, it is not a particularly
interesting story. Told in the same bald way, the
story of Theseus or of Hercules would still have much
more in it; there are many more adventures than this
in later romances like <i>Sir Bevis of Southampton</i> or <i>Sir
Huon of Bordeaux</i>. What makes the poem of <i>Beowulf</i>
really interesting, and different from the later romances,
is that it is full of all sorts of references and allusions
to great events, to the fortunes of kings and nations,
which seem to come in naturally, as if the author had
in his mind the whole history of all the people who
were in any way connected with Beowulf, and could
not keep his knowledge from showing itself. There
is an historical background. In romances, and also in
popular tales, you may get the same sort of adventures
as in <i>Beowulf</i>, but they are told in quite a different way.
They have nothing to do with reality. In <i>Beowulf</i>, the
historical allusions are so many, and given with such a
conviction of their importance and their truth, that
they draw away the attention from the main events of
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
the story&mdash;the fights with the ogre Grendel and his
mother, and the killing of the dragon. This is one
of the faults of the poem. The story is rather thin and
poor. But in another way those distracting allusions
to things apart from the chief story make up for their
want of proportion. They give the impression of
reality and weight; the story is not in the air, or in a
fabulous country like that of Spenser&rsquo;s <i>Faerie Queene</i>;
it is part of the solid world. It would be difficult to
find anything like this in later medieval romance. It
is this, chiefly, that makes <i>Beowulf</i> a true <i>epic</i> poem&mdash;that
is, a narrative poem of the most stately and serious
kind.</p>
<p>The history in it is not English history; the personages
in it are Danes, Gauts, and Swedes. One of
them, Hygelac, the king whom Beowulf succeeded, is
identified with a king named by the Frankish historian
Gregory of Tours; the date is about <span class="small">A.D.</span> 515. The
epic poem of <i>Beowulf</i> has its source pretty far back,
in the history of countries not very closely related to
England. Yet the English hearers of the poem were
expected to follow the allusions, and to be interested
in the names and histories of Swedish, Gautish, and
Danish kings. As if that was not enough, there is a
story within the story&mdash;a poem of adventure is chanted
by a minstrel at the Danish Court, and the scene of this
poem is in Friesland. There is no doubt that it was a
favourite subject, for the Frisian story is mentioned in
the poem of Widsith, the Traveller; and more than
that, there is an independent version of it among the
few remains of Anglo-Saxon heroic poetry&mdash;<i>The Fight
at Finnesburh</i>. Those who listened to heroic songs in
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
England seem to have had no peculiar liking for
English subjects. Their heroes belong to <i>Germania</i>.
The same thing is found in Norway and Iceland,
where the favourite hero is Sigurd. His story, the
story of the Volsungs and Niblungs, comes from
Germany. In <i>Beowulf</i> there is a reference to it&mdash;not
to Sigfred himself, but to his father Sigemund.
Everywhere and in every possible way the old heroic
poets seem to escape from the particular nation to
which they belong, and to look for their subjects in
some other part of the Teutonic system. In some
cases, doubtless, this might be due to the same kind of
romantic taste as led later authors to place their stories
in Greece, or Babylon, or anywhere far from home.
But it can scarcely have been so with <i>Beowulf</i>; for
the author of <i>Beowulf</i> does not try to get away from
reality; on the contrary, he buttresses his story all
round with historical tradition and references to
historical fact; he will not let it go forth as pure
romance.</p>
<p>The solid foundation and epic weight of <i>Beowulf</i>
are not exceptional among the Anglo-Saxon poems.
There are not many other poems extant of the same
class, but there is enough to show that <i>Beowulf</i> is not
alone. It is a representative work; there were others
of the same type; and it is this order of epic poetry
which makes the great literary distinction of the Anglo-Saxon
period.</p>
<p>It is always necessary to remember how little we
know of Anglo-Saxon poetry and generally of the ideas
and imaginations of the early English. The gravity
and dignity of most of their poetical works are unquestionable;
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
but one ought not to suppose that we
know all the varieties of their poetical taste.</p>
<p>It is probable that in the earlier Middle Ages, and
in the Teutonic countries, there was a good deal of the
fanciful and also of the comic literature which is so
frequent in the later Middle Ages (after 1100) and
especially in France. One proof of this, for the fanciful
and romantic sort of story-telling, will be found in
the earlier part of the Danish history written by Saxo
Grammaticus. He collected an immense number of
stories from Danes and Icelanders&mdash;one of them being
the story of Hamlet&mdash;and although he was comparatively
late (writing at the end of the twelfth century),
still we know that his stories belong to the North and
are unaffected by anything French; they form a body
of Northern romance, independent of the French
fashions, of King Arthur and Charlemagne. The
English historians&mdash;William of Malmesbury, e.g.&mdash;have
collected many things of the same sort. As for
comic stories, there are one or two in careful Latin
verse, composed in Germany in the tenth century,
which show that the same kind of jests were current
then as in the later comic poetry of France, in the
<i>Decameron</i> of Boccaccio, and in the <i>Canterbury Tales</i>.
The earlier Middle Ages were more like the later
Middle Ages than one would think, judging merely
from the extant literature of the Anglo-Saxon period
on the one hand and of the Plantagenet times on the
other. But the differences are there, and one of the
greatest is between the Anglo-Saxon fashion of epic
poetry and the popular romances of the time of
Edward I or Edward III.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<p>The difference is brought out in many ways. There
is a different choice of subject; the earlier poetry,
by preference, is concentrated on one great battle or
combat&mdash;generally in a place where there is little or
no chance of escape&mdash;inside a hall, as in <i>The Fight at
Finnesburh</i>, and in the slaughter &lsquo;grim and great&rsquo;
at the end of the <i>Nibelungenlied</i>; or, it may be, in a
narrow place among rocks, as in the story of Walter of
Aquitaine, which is the old English <i>Waldere</i>. This is
the favourite sort of subject, and it is so because the
poets were able thus to hit their audience again and
again with increasing force; the effect they aimed at
was a crushing impression of strife and danger, and
courage growing as the danger grew and the strength
lessened. In <i>Beowulf</i> the subjects are different, but in
<i>Beowulf</i> a subject of this sort is introduced, by way of
interlude, in the minstrel&rsquo;s song of <i>Finnesburh</i>; and
also <i>Beowulf</i>, with a rather inferior plot, still manages
to give the effect and to bring out the spirit of deliberate
heroic valour.</p>
<p>Quite late in the Anglo-Saxon period&mdash;about the
year 1000&mdash;there is a poem on an English subject in
which this heroic spirit is most thoroughly displayed:
the poem on the Battle of Maldon which was fought
on the Essex shore in 993 between Byrhtnoth, alderman
of East Anglia, and a host of vikings whose leader
(though he is not mentioned in the poem) is known as
Olaf Tryggvason. By the end of the tenth century
Anglo-Saxon poetry had begun to decay. Yet the
Maldon poem shows that it was not only still alive,
but that in some respects it had made very remarkable
progress. There are few examples anywhere of poetry
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
which can deal in a satisfactory way with contemporary
heroes. In the Maldon poem, very shortly after the
battle, the facts are turned into poetry&mdash;into poetry
which keeps the form of the older epic, and which in
the old manner works up a stronger and stronger swell
of courage against the overwhelming ruin. The last
word of the heroic age is spoken, five hundred years
after the death of Hygelac (above, <a href="#Page_26">p. 26</a>), by the old
warrior who, like the trusty companion of Beowulf,
refused to turn and run when his lord was cut down
in the battle:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Thought shall be the harder, heart the keener,</p>
<p class="t0">Mood the more, as our might lessens.</p>
</div>
<p>It is one of the strange things in the history of poetry
that in another five hundred years an old fashion of
poetry, near akin to the Anglo-Saxon, comes to an end
in a poem on a contemporary battle The last poem
in the Middle English alliterative verse, which was
used for so many subjects in the fourteenth century&mdash;for
the stories of Arthur and Alexander and Troy, and
for the Vision of Piers Plowman&mdash;is the poem of
<i>Scottish Field</i> <span class="small">A.D.</span> 1513, on the battle of Flodden.</p>
<p>This alliterative verse, which has a history of more
than a thousand years, is one of the things that are
carried over in some mysterious way from the Anglo-Saxon
to the later medieval period. But though it
survives the great change in the language, it has a
different sound in the fourteenth century from what
it has in <i>Beowulf</i>; the older verse has a manner of its
own.</p>
<p>The Anglo-Saxon poetical forms are difficult at
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
first to understand. The principal rule of the verse
is indeed easy enough; it is the same as in the verse of
<i>Piers Plowman</i>; there is a long line divided in the
middle; in each line there are <i>four</i> strong syllables;
the first <i>three</i> of these are generally made alliterative;

<p>But there is a variety and subtilty in the Anglo-Saxon
measure which is not found in the Middle
English, and which is much more definitely under
metrical rules. And apart from the metre of the single
line, there is in the older alliterative poetry a skill in
composing long passages, best described in the terms
which Milton used about his own blank verse: &lsquo;the
sense variously drawn out from one line to another&rsquo;.
The Anglo-Saxon poets, at their best, are eloquent, and
able to carry on for long periods without monotony.
Their verse does not fall into detached and separate
lines. This habit is another evidence of long culture;
Anglo-Saxon poetry, such as we know it, is at the end
of its progress; already mature, and with little prospect
in front of it except decay.</p>
<p>The diction of Anglo-Saxon poetry is a subject of
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
study by itself. Here again there is a great difference
between Anglo-Saxon and Middle English poetry.
Middle English poetry borrows greatly from French.
Now in all the best French poetry, with very few
exceptions, the language is the same as that of prose;
and even if there happen to be a few poetical words
(as in Racine, for example, <i>flammes</i> and <i>transports</i> and
<i>hymen&eacute;e</i>) they do not interfere with the sense. Middle
English generally copies French, and is generally
unpretentious in its vocabulary. But Anglo-Saxon
poetry was impossible without a poetical dictionary.
It is very heavily ornamented with words not used in
prose, and while there are hardly any similes, the whole
tissue of it is figurative, and most things are named two
or three times over in different terms. This makes it
often very tiresome, when the meaning is so encrusted
with splendid words that it can scarcely move; still
more, when a poet does not take the trouble to invent
his ornaments, and only repeats conventional phrases
out of a vocabulary which he has learned by rote. But
those extravagances of the Anglo-Saxon poetry make
it all the more interesting historically; they show that
there must have been a general love and appreciation
of fine language, such as is not commonly found in
England now, and also a technical skill in verse, something
like that which is encouraged in Wales at the
modern poetical competitions, though certainly far less
elaborate. Further, these curiosities of old English
verse make it all the more wonderful and admirable
that the epic poets should have succeeded as they did
with their stories of heroic resistance and the repeated
waves of battle and death-agony. Tremendous subjects
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
are easily spoilt when the literary vogue is all for
ornament and fine language. Yet the Anglo-Saxon
poets seldom seem to feel the encumbrances of their
poetic language when they are really possessed with
their subject. The eloquence of their verse then gets
the better of their ornamental diction.</p>
<p>The subjects of Anglo-Saxon poetry were taken
from many different sources besides the heroic legend
which is summarized by Widsith, or contemporary
actions like the battle of Maldon.</p>
<p>The conversion of the English to Christianity
brought with it of course a great deal of Latin literature.
The new ideas were adopted very readily by the
English, and a hundred years after the coming of the
first missionary the Northumbrian schools and teachers
were more than equal to the best in any part of Europe.</p>
<p>The new learning did not always discourage the old
native kind of poetry. Had that been the case, we
should hardly have had anything like <i>Beowulf</i>; we
should not have had the poem of Maldon. Christianity
and Christian literature did not always banish the old-fashioned
heroes. Tastes varied in this respect. The
Frankish Emperor Lewis the Pious is said to have
taken a disgust at the heathen poetry which he had
learned when he was young. But there were greater
kings who were less delicate in their religion. Charles
the Great made a collection of &lsquo;the barbarous ancient
poems which sung the wars and exploits of the olden
time&rsquo;. Alfred the Great, his Welsh biographer tells us,
was always ready to listen to Saxon poems when he was
a boy, and when he was older was fond of learning
poetry by heart. That the poems were not all of them
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
religious, we may see from some things in Alfred&rsquo;s
own writings. He was bold enough to bring in a
Northern hero in his translation of the Latin philosophical
book of Boethius. Boethius asks, &lsquo;Where are
the bones of Fabricius the true-hearted?&rsquo; In place of
the name Fabricius, Alfred writes, &lsquo;Where are now the
bones of Wayland, and who knows where they be?&rsquo;
Wayland Smith, who thus appears, oddly, in the
translation of Boethius, is one of the best-known heroes
of the Teutonic mythology. He is the original
craftsman (like Daedalus in Greece), the brother of the
mythical archer Egil and the harper Slagfinn&mdash;the hero
of one of the finest of the old Scandinavian poems, and
of many another song and story.</p>
<p>The royal genealogies in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle
are an example of the conservative process that went
on with regard to many of the old beliefs and fancies&mdash;a
process that may be clearly traced in the poem of
<i>Beowulf</i>&mdash;by means of which pre-Christian ideas were
annexed to Christianity. The royal house of England,
the house of Cerdic, still traces its descent from
Woden; and Woden is thirteenth in descent from
Noah. Woden is kept as a king and a hero, when he
has ceased to be a god. This was kindlier and more
charitable than the alternative view, that the gods of
the heathen were living devils.</p>
<p>There was no destruction of the heroic poetry
through the conversion of the English, but new themes
were at once brought in, to compete with the old ones.
Bede was born (672) within fifty years of the baptism
of King Edwin of Northumbria (625), and Bede is
able to tell of the poet C&aelig;dmon of Whitby who
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
belonged to the time of the abbess Hild, between 658
and 670, and who put large portions of the Bible
history into verse.</p>
<p>C&aelig;dmon the herdsman, turning poet late in life
by a special gift from Heaven and devoting himself
exclusively to sacred subjects, is a different sort of
minstrel from that one who is introduced in <i>Beowulf</i>
singing the lay of Finnesburh. His motive is different.
It is partly the same motive as that of King Alfred in
his prose translations. C&aelig;dmon made versions of
Bible history for the edification of Christian people.</p>
<p>Anglo-Saxon poetry, which had been heathen,
Teutonic, concerned with traditional heroic subjects
was drawn into the service of the other world without
losing its old interests. Hence comes, apart from the
poetical value of the several works, the historical
importance of Anglo-Saxon poetry, as a blending of
<i>Germania</i>, the original Teutonic civilization, with the
ideas and sentiments of Christendom in the seventh
century and after.</p>
<p>Probably nothing of C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s work remains except
the first poem, which is paraphrased in Latin by Bede
and which is also preserved in the original Northumbrian.
But there are many Bible poems, <i>Genesis</i>,
<i>Exodus</i>, and others, besides a poem on the Gospel
history in the Saxon language of the Continent&mdash;the
language of the &lsquo;Old Saxons&rsquo;, as the English called
them&mdash;which followed the example and impulse given
by C&aelig;dmon, and which had in common the didactic,
the educational purpose, for the promotion of Christian
knowledge.</p>
<p>But while there was this common purpose in these
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
poems, there were as great diversities of genius as in
any other literary group or school. Sometimes the
author is a dull mechanical translator using the conventional
forms and phrases without imagination or spirit.
Sometimes on the other hand he is caught up and
carried away by his subject, and the result is poetry
like the <i>Fall of the Angels</i> (part of <i>Genesis</i>), or the
<i>Dream of the Rood</i>. These are utterly different from
the regular conventional poetry or prose of the Middle
Ages. There is no harm in comparing the <i>Fall of the
Angels</i> with Milton. The method is nearly the same:
narrative, with a concentration on the character of
Satan, and dramatic expression of the character in
monologue at length. The <i>Dream of the Rood</i> again
is finer than the noblest of all the Passion Plays. It is a
vision, in which the Gospel history of the Crucifixion
is so translated that nothing is left except the devotion
of the young hero (so he is called) and the glory; it is
not acted on any historical scene, but in some spiritual
place where there is no distinction between the Passion
and the Triumph. In this way the spirit of poetry
does wonderful things; transforming the historical
substance. It is quite impossible to dismiss the old
English religious poetry under any summary description.
Much of it is conventional and ordinary; some
of it is otherwise, and the separate poems live in their
own way.</p>
<p class="tb">It is worth remembering that the manuscripts of the
<i>Dream of the Rood</i> have a history which is typical of
the history in general, the progress of Anglo-Saxon
poetry, and the change of centre from Northumberland
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
to Wessex. Some verses of the poem are carved in
runic letters on the Ruthwell Cross (now in the Parish
Church of Ruthwell in Dumfriesshire) in the language
of Northumberland, which was the language of C&aelig;dmon
and Bede. The Ruthwell Cross with the runic
inscription on it is thus one of the oldest poetical
manuscripts in English, not to speak of its importance
in other ways.</p>
<p>The Ruthwell verses are Northumbrian. They
were at first misinterpreted in various ways by antiquaries,
till John Kemble the historian read them truly.
Some time after, an Anglo-Saxon manuscript was
found at Vercelli in the North of Italy&mdash;a regular
station on the old main road which crosses the Great
St. Bernard and which was commonly used by Englishmen,
Danes, and other people of the North when
travelling to Rome. In this Vercelli book the <i>Dream
of the Rood</i> is contained, nearly in full, but written in
the language of Wessex&mdash;i.e. the language commonly
called Anglo-Saxon&mdash;the language not of Bede but of
Alfred. The West Saxon verses of the <i>Rood</i> corresponding
to the old Anglian of the Ruthwell Cross are
an example of what happened generally with Anglo-Saxon
poetry&mdash;the best of it in early days was Anglian,
Northumbrian; when the centre shifted to Wessex,
the Northern poetry was preserved in the language
which by that time had become the proper literary
English both for verse and prose.</p>
<p>Cynewulf is an old English poet who has signed his
name to several poems, extant in West Saxon. He
may have been the author of the <i>Dream of the Rood</i>;
he was probably a Northumbrian. As he is the most
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
careful artist among the older poets, notable for the
skill of his verse and phrasing, his poetry has to be
studied attentively by any one who wishes to understand
the poetical ideals of the age between Bede and
King Alfred, the culmination of the Northumbrian
school. His subjects are all religious, from the Gospel
(<i>Crist</i>) or the lives of saints (<i>Guthlac</i>, <i>Juliana</i>, <i>Elene</i>,
probably <i>Andreas</i> also). The legendary subjects may
be looked on as a sort of romance; Cynewulf in many
ways is a romantic poet. The adventure of St.
Andrew in his voyage to rescue St. Matthew from the
cannibals is told with great spirit&mdash;a story of the sea.
Cynewulf has so fine a sense of the minor beauties of
verse and diction that he might be in danger of losing
his story for the sake of poetical ornament; but though
he is not a strong poet he generally manages to avoid
the temptation, and to keep the refinements of his art
subordinate to the main effect.</p>
<p>There is hardly anything in Anglo-Saxon to be
called lyrical. The epic poetry may have grown out
of an older lyric type&mdash;a song in chorus, with narrative
stuff in it, like the later choral ballads. There is one
old poem, and a very remarkable one, with a refrain,
<i>Deor&rsquo;s Lament</i>, which may be called a dramatic lyric,
the utterance of an imaginary personage, a poet like
Widsith, who comforts himself in his sorrow by
recalling examples of old distresses. The burden
comes after each of these records:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">That ancient woe was endured, and so may mine.</p>
</div>
<p><i>Widsith</i> in form of verse is nearer to this lyric of <i>Deor</i>
than to the regular sustained narrative verse of <i>Beowulf</i>.
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
There are some fragments of popular verse, spells
against disease, which might be called songs. But
what is most wanting in Anglo-Saxon literature is the
sort of poetry found at the close of the Middle Ages
in the popular ballads, songs and carols of the fifteenth
century.</p>
<p>To make up for the want of true lyric, there are a
few very beautiful poems, sometimes called by the
name of elegies&mdash;akin to lyric, but not quite at the
lyrical pitch. The <i>Wanderer</i>, the <i>Seafarer</i>, the <i>Ruin</i>,
the <i>Wife&rsquo;s Complaint</i>&mdash;they are antique in verse and
language but modern in effect, more than most things
that come later, for many centuries. They are poems
of reflective sentiment, near to the mood of a time
when the bolder poetical kinds have been exhausted,
and nothing is left but to refine upon the older themes.
These poems are the best expression of a mood found
elsewhere, even in rather early Anglo-Saxon days&mdash;the
sense of the vanity of life, the melancholy regret
for departed glories&mdash;a kind of thought which popular
opinion calls &lsquo;the Celtic spirit&rsquo;, and which indeed may
be found in the Ossianic poems, but not more truly
than in the <i>Ruin</i> or the <i>Wanderer</i>.</p>
<p>When the language of Wessex became the literary
English, it was naturally used for poetry&mdash;not merely
for translations of Northumbrian verse into West
Saxon. The strange thing about this later poetry
is that it should be capable of such strength as is
shown in the Maldon poem&mdash;a perpetual warning
against rash conclusions. For poetry had seemed to
be exhausted long before this, or at any rate to have
reached in Cynewulf the dangerous stage of maturity.
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
But the Maldon poem, apart from some small technical
faults, is sane and strong. In contrast, the earlier
poem in the battle of Brunanburh is a fair conventional
piece&mdash;academic laureate work, using cleverly enough
the forms which any accomplished gentleman could
learn.</p>
<p>Those forms are applied often most ingeniously,
in the Anglo-Saxon riddles; pieces, again, which
contradict ordinary opinion. Few would expect to
find in Anglo-Saxon the curious grace of verbal
workmanship, the artificial wit, of those short poems.</p>
<p>The dialogue of <i>Salomon and Saturnus</i> is one of the
Anglo-Saxon things belonging to a common European
fashion; the dialogue literature, partly didactic, partly
comic, which was so useful in the Middle Ages in
providing instruction along with varying degrees of
amusement. There is more than one Anglo-Saxon
piece of this sort, valuable as expressing the ordinary
mind; for, generally speaking, there is a want of
merely popular literature in Anglo-Saxon, as compared
with the large amount later on.</p>
<p class="tb">The history of prose is continuous from the Anglo-Saxon
onwards; there is no such division as between
Anglo-Saxon and Middle English poetry. In fact,
Middle English prose at first is the continuation of the
English Chronicle, and the transcription of the homilies
of &AElig;lfric into the later grammar and spelling.</p>
<p>The English had not the peculiar taste for prose
which seems to be dealt by chance to Hebrews and
Arabs, to Ireland and Iceland. As in Greece and
France, the writing of prose comes after verse. It
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
begins by being useful; it is not used for heroic stories.
But the English had more talent for prose than some
people; they understood it better than the French;
and until the French influence came over them did
not habitually degrade their verse for merely useful
purposes.</p>
<p>Through the Chronicle, which probably began in
King Alfred&rsquo;s time, and through Alfred&rsquo;s translations
from the Latin, a common available prose was established,
which had all sorts of possibilities in it, partly
realized after a time. There seems no reason, as far as
language and technical ability are concerned, why there
should not have been in English, prose stories as good
as those of Iceland. The episode of King Cynewulf
of Wessex, in the Chronicle, has been compared to the
Icelandic sagas, and to the common epic theme of
valorous fighting and loyal perseverance. In Alfred&rsquo;s
narrative passages there are all the elements of plain
history, a style that might have been used without
limit for all the range of experience.</p>
<p>Alfred&rsquo;s prose when he is repeating the narratives
of his sea-captains has nothing in it that can possibly
weary, so long as the subject is right. It is a perfectly
clean style for matter of fact.</p>
<p>The great success of Anglo-Saxon prose is in religious
instruction. This is various in kind; it includes the
translation of Boethius which is philosophy, and fancy
as well; it includes the Dialogues of Gregory which are
popular stories, the homilies on Saints&rsquo; Lives which are
often prose romances, and which often are heightened
above prose, into a swelling, chanting, alliterative tune,
not far from the language of poetry. The great master
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
of prose in all its forms is &AElig;lfric of Eynsham, about
the year 1000. Part of his work was translation of the
Bible, and in this, and in his theory of translation, he is
more enlightened than any translator before Tyndale.
The fault of Bible versions generally was that they
kept too close to the original. Instead of translating
like free men they construed word for word, like the
illiterate in all ages. Ulphilas, who is supposed by
some to have written Gothic prose, is really a slave to
the Greek text, and his Gothic is hardly a human
language. Wycliffe treats his Latin original in the
same way, and does not think what language he is
supposed to be writing. But &AElig;lfric works on principles
that would have been approved by Dryden;
and there is no better evidence of the humanities in
those early times than this. Much was lost before
the work of &AElig;lfric was taken up again with equal
intelligence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">CHAPTER III</span>
<br />THE MIDDLE ENGLISH PERIOD, 1150-1500</h2>
<h3>INTRODUCTORY</h3>
<p>Anglo-Saxon and Middle English literature had
many things in common. The educational work of
King Alfred was continued all through the Middle
Ages. Chaucer translates Boethius, five hundred years
after King Alfred&rsquo;s translation. The same authors are
read and adapted. The sermons of &AElig;lfric, <span class="small">A.D.</span> 1000,
have the same sort of matter as those of the thirteenth
or the fourteenth century, and there is no very great
difference of tone. Many of the literary interests of
the Plantagenet times are found already among the
Anglo-Saxons. The Legends of the Saints are inexhaustible
subjects of poetical treatment in the earlier
as well as the later days. The poetical expression is,
of course, very greatly changed, but earlier or later the
Saints&rsquo; Lives are used as material for literature which
is essentially romantic, whatever its other qualities
may be. There are other sources of romance open,
long before the French influence begins to be felt in
England; particularly, the wonders of the East appear
in the Anglo-Saxon version of Alexander&rsquo;s letter to
Aristotle; and later Greek romance (through the
Latin) in the Anglo-Saxon translation of <i>Apollonius of
Tyre</i>.</p>
<p>The great difference between the two ages is made
by the disappearance of the old English poetry. There
is nothing in the Plantagenet reigns like <i>Beowulf</i> or
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
the Maldon poem; there is nothing like the <i>Fall of
the Angels</i> and the dramatic eloquence of Satan. The
pathos of the later Middle Ages is expressed in a
different way from the <i>Wanderer</i> and the <i>Ruin</i>. The
later religious poetry has little in it to recall the finished
art of Cynewulf. Anglo-Saxon poetry, whether
derived from heathendom or from the Church, has
ideas and manners of its own; it comes to perfection,
and then it dies away. The gravity and thought of the
heroic poetry, as well as the finer work of the religious
poets, are unlike the strength, unlike the graces, of the
later time. Anglo-Saxon poetry grows to a rich
maturity, and past it; then, with the new forms of
language and under new influences, the poetical
education has to start again.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for the historian, there are scarcely
any literary things remaining to show the progress of
the transition. For a long time before and after
1100 there is a great scarcity of English productions.
It is not till about 1200 that Middle English literature
begins to be at all fully represented.</p>
<p>This scantiness is partly due, no doubt, to an actual
disuse of English composition. But many written
things must have perished, and in poetry there was
certainly a large amount of verse current orally, whether
it was ever written down or not. This is the inference
drawn from the passages in the historian William of
Malmesbury to which Macaulay refers in his preface
to the <i>Lays of Ancient Rome</i>, and which Freeman has
studied in his essay on <i>The Mythical and Romantic
Elements in Early English History</i>. The story of
Hereward the Wake is extant in Latin; the story of
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
Havelock the Dane and others were probably composed
in English verse much earlier than the thirteenth
century, and in much older forms than those which
have come down to us.</p>
<p>There is a gap in the record of alliterative poetry
which shows plainly that much has been lost. It is a
curious history. Before the Norman conquest the
old English verse had begun to go to pieces, in spite
of such excellent late examples as the Maldon poem.
About 1200 the alliterative verse, though it has still
something of its original character, is terribly broken
down. The verse of Layamon&rsquo;s <i>Brut</i> is unsteady,
never to be trusted, changing its pace without warning
in a most uncomfortable way. Then suddenly, as late
as the middle of the fourteenth century, there begins a
procession of magnificent alliterative poems, in regular
verse&mdash;<i>Sir Gawayne</i>, the <i>Morte Arthure</i>, <i>Piers Plowman</i>;
in regular verse, not exactly with the same rule as
<i>Beowulf</i>, but with so much of the old rule as seemed to
have been hopelessly lost for a century or two. What
is the explanation of this revival, and this sudden great
vogue of alliterative poetry? It cannot have been a
new invention, or a reconstruction; it would not in
that case have copied, as it sometimes does, the rhythm
of the old English verse in a way which is unlike the
ordinary rhythms of the fourteenth century. The
only reasonable explanation is that somewhere in
England there was a tradition of alliterative verse,
keeping in the main to the old rules of rhythm as it
kept something of the old vocabulary, and escaping
the disease which affected the old verse elsewhere.
The purer sort of verse must have been preserved for
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
a few hundred years with hardly a trace of it among the
existing documents to show what it was like till it
breaks out &lsquo;three-score thousand strong&rsquo; in the reign
of Edward III.</p>
<p>In the Middle Ages, early and late, there was very
free communication all over Christendom between
people of different languages. Languages seem to have
given much less trouble than they do nowadays. The
general use of Latin, of course, made things easy for
those who could speak it; but without Latin, people of
different nations appear to have travelled over the
world picking up foreign languages as they went along,
and showing more interest in the poetry and stories
of foreign countries than is generally found among
modern tourists. Luther said of the people of
Flanders that if you took a Fleming in a sack and carried
him over France or Italy, he would manage to learn
the tongues. This gift was useful to commercial
travellers, and perhaps the Flemings had more of it
than other people. But in all the nations there seems
to have been something like this readiness, and in all
it was used to translate the stories and adapt the poetry
of other tongues. This intercourse was greatly
quickened in the twelfth century through a number of
causes, the principal cause being the extraordinary
production of new poetry in France, or rather in the
two regions, North and South, and the two languages,
French and Proven&ccedil;al. Between these two languages,
in the North and the South of what is now France,
there was in the Middle Ages a kind of division of
labour. The North took narrative poetry, the South
took lyric; and French narrative and Proven&ccedil;al lyric
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
poetry in the twelfth century between them made
the beginning of modern literature for the whole of
Europe.</p>
<p>In the earlier Middle Ages, before 1100, as in the
later, the common language is Latin. Between the
Latin authors of the earlier time&mdash;Gregory the Great,
or Bede&mdash;and those of the later&mdash;Anselm, or Thomas
Aquinas&mdash;there may be great differences, but there is
no line of separation.</p>
<p>In the literature of the native tongues there is a line
of division about 1100 more definite than any later
epoch; it is made by the appearance of French
poetry, bringing along with it an intellectual unity of
Christendom which has never been shaken since.</p>
<p>The importance of this is that it meant a mutual
understanding among the laity of Europe, equal to
that which had so long obtained among the clergy, the
learned men.</p>
<p>The year 1100, in which all Christendom is united,
if not thoroughly and actively in all places, for the
conquest of the Holy Sepulchre, at any rate ideally
by the thought of this common enterprise, is also a
year from which may be dated the beginning of the
common lay intelligence of Europe, that sympathy
of understanding by which ideas of different sorts
are taken up and diffused, outside of the professionally
learned bodies. The year 1100 is a good date, because
of the first Proven&ccedil;al poet, William, Count of Poitiers,
who was living then; he went on the Crusade three
years later. He is the first poet of modern Europe
who definitely helps to set a fashion of poetry not only
for his own people but for the imitation of foreigners.
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
He is the first modern poet; he uses the kind of verse
which every one uses now.</p>
<p>The triumph of French poetry in the twelfth century
was the end of the old Teutonic world&mdash;an end which
had been long preparing, though it came suddenly at
last. Before that time there had been the sympathy
and informal union among the Germanic nations out
of which the old heroic poems had come; such community
of ideas as allowed the Nibelung story to be
treated in all the Germanic tongues from Austria to
Iceland, and even in Greenland, the furthest outpost
of the Northmen. But after the eleventh century
there was nothing new to be got out of this. Here and
there may be found a gleaner, like Saxo Grammaticus,
getting together all that he can save out of the ancient
heathendom, or like the Norwegian traveller about
fifty years later, who collected North German ballads
of Theodoric and other champions, and paraphrased
them in Norwegian prose. The really great achievement
of the older world in its last days was in the prose
histories of Iceland, which had virtue enough in them
to change the whole world, if they had only been known
and understood; but they were written for domestic
circulation, and even their own people scarcely knew
how good they were. Germania was falling to pieces,
the separate nations growing more and more stupid
and drowsy.</p>
<p>The languages derived from Latin&mdash;commonly
called the Romance languages&mdash;French and Proven&ccedil;al,
Italian and so on&mdash;were long of declaring themselves.
The Italian and Spanish dialects had to wait for the
great French outburst before they could produce
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
anything. French and Proven&ccedil;al, which are well in
front of Spanish and Italian, have little of importance
to show before 1100. But after that date there is such
profusion that it is clear there had been a long time of
experiment and preparation. The earlier French epics
have been lost; the earliest known Proven&ccedil;al poet is
already a master of verse, and must be indebted to
many poetical ancestors whose names and poems have
disappeared. Long before 1100 there must have
been a common literary taste in France, fashions of
poetry well understood and appreciated, a career open
for youthful poets. In the twelfth century the social
success of poetry in France was extended in different
degrees over all Europe. In Italy and Spain the
fashions were taken up; in Germany they conquered
even more quickly and thoroughly; the Danes and
Swedes and Norwegians learned their ballad measures
from the French; even the Icelanders, the only
Northern nation with a classical literature and with
minds of their own, were caught in the same way.</p>
<p>Thus French poetry wakened up the sleepy countries,
and gave new ideas to the wakeful; it brought the
Teutonic and Romance nations to agree and, what was
much more important, to produce new works of their
own which might be original in all sorts of ways while
still keeping within the limits of the French tradition.
Compared with this, all later literary revolutions are
secondary and partial changes. The most widely
influential writers of later ages&mdash;e.g. Petrarch and
Voltaire&mdash;had the ground prepared for them in this
medieval epoch, and do nothing to alter the general
conditions which were then established&mdash;the intercommunication
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
among the whole laity of Europe with
regard to questions of taste.</p>
<p>It seems probable that the Normans had a good
deal to do as agents in this revolution. They were
in relation with many different people. They had
Bretons on their borders in Normandy; they conquered
England, and then they touched upon the
Welsh; they were fond of pilgrimages; they settled
in Apulia and Sicily, where they had dealings with
Greeks and Saracens as well as Italians.</p>
<p>It is a curious thing that early in the twelfth century
names are found in Italy which certainly come from
the romances of King Arthur&mdash;the name Galvano, e.g.
which is the same as Gawain. However it was brought
there, this name may be taken for a sign of the process
that was going on everywhere&mdash;the conversion of
Europe to fashions which were prescribed in France.</p>
<p>The narrative poetry in which the French excelled
was of different kinds. An old French poet, in an
epic on Charlemagne&rsquo;s wars against the Saxons, has
given a classification which is well known, dividing the
stories according to the historical matter which they
employ. There are three &lsquo;matters&rsquo;, he says, and no
more than three, which a story-teller may take up&mdash;the
matter of France, the matter of Britain, the matter
of Rome the Great. The old poet is right in naming
these as at any rate the chief groups; since &lsquo;Rome the
Great&rsquo; might be made to take in whatever would not
go into the other two divisions, there is nothing much
wrong in his refusal to make a fourth class. The
&lsquo;matter of France&rsquo; includes all the subjects of the old
French national epics&mdash;such as Roncevaux, or the song
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
of Roland; Reynold of Montalban, or the Four Sons
of Aymon; Ferabras; Ogier the Dane. The matter of
Britain includes all the body of the Arthurian legend,
as well as the separate stories commonly called Breton
lays (like Chaucer&rsquo;s Franklin&rsquo;s Tale). The matter
of Rome is not only Roman history, but the whole of
classical antiquity. The story of Troy, of course, is
rightly part of Roman history, and so is the Romance
of Eneas. But under Rome the Great there fall other
stories which have much slighter connexion with
Rome&mdash;such as the story of Thebes, or of Alexander.</p>
<p>Many of those subjects were of course well known
and popular before the French poets took them up.
The romantic story of Alexander might, in part at
any rate, have been familiar to Alfred the Great; he
brings the Egyptian king &lsquo;Nectanebus the wizard&rsquo; into
his translation of Orosius&mdash;Nectanebus, who is the
father of Alexander in the apocryphal book from which
the romances were derived. But it was not till the
French poets turned the story of Alexander into verse
that it really made much impression outside of France.
The tale of Troy was widely read, in various authors&mdash;Ovid
and Virgil, and an abstract of the <i>Iliad</i>, and in the
apocryphal prose books of Dares the Phrygian and
Dictys the Cretan, who were supposed to have been at
the seat of war, and therefore to be better witnesses
than Homer. These were used and translated some
times apart from any French suggestion. But it was
the French <i>Roman de Troie</i>, written in the twelfth
century, which spread the story everywhere&mdash;the
source of innumerable Troy Books in all languages,
and of Chaucer&rsquo;s and Shakespeare&rsquo;s <i>Troilus</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</div>
<p>The &lsquo;matter of Britain&rsquo; also was generally made
known through the works of French authors. There
are exceptions; the British history of Geoffrey of
Monmouth was written in Latin. But even this found
its way into English by means of a French translation;
the <i>Brut</i> of Layamon, a long poem in irregular alliterative
verse, is adapted from a French rhyming translation
of Geoffrey&rsquo;s History. The English romances of Sir
Perceval, Sir Gawain and other knights are founded on
French poems.</p>
<p>There is an important distinction between the
&lsquo;matter of France&rsquo; and the &lsquo;matters&rsquo; of Britain and
Rome; this distinction belongs more properly to the
history of French literature, but it ought not to be
neglected here. The &lsquo;matter of France&rsquo;, which is
exemplified in the song of Roland, belongs to an earlier
time, and was made into French poetry earlier than the
other subjects. The poems about Charlemagne and
his peers, and others of the same sort, are sometimes
called the old French epics; the French name for them
is <i>chansons de geste</i>. Those epics have not only a
different matter but a different form from the French
Arthurian romances and the French <i>Roman de Troie</i>.
What is of more importance for English poetry, there
is generally a different tone and sentiment. They are
older, stronger, more heroic, more like <i>Beowulf</i> or the
Maldon poem; the romances of the &lsquo;matter of Britain&rsquo;,
on the other hand, are the fashionable novels of the
twelfth century; their subjects are really taken from
contemporary polite society. They are long love-stories,
and their motive chiefly is to represent the
fortunes, and, above all, the sentiments of true lovers.
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
Roughly speaking, the &lsquo;matter of France&rsquo; is action,
the &lsquo;matter of Britain&rsquo; is sentiment. The &lsquo;matter of
Rome&rsquo; is mixed; for while the <i>Roman de Troie</i> (with
the love-story of Troilus, and with courteous modern
manners throughout) is like the romances of Lancelot
and Tristram, Alexander, in the French versions, is a
hero like those of the national epics, and is celebrated
in the same manner as Charlemagne.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;matter of France&rsquo; could not be popular in
England as it was in its native country. But Charlemagne
and Roland and his peers were well known
everywhere, like Arthur and Alexander, and the &lsquo;matter
of France&rsquo; went to increase the stories told by English
minstrels. It was from an English version, in the
thirteenth century, that part of the long Norwegian
prose history of Charlemagne was taken; a fact worth
remembering, to illustrate the way in which the
exportation of stories was carried on. Of course, the
story of Charlemagne was not the same sort of thing
in England or Norway that it was in France. The
devotion to France which is so intense in the song of
Roland was never meant to be shared by any foreigner.
But Roland as a champion against the infidels was a
hero everywhere. There are statues of him in Bremen
and in Verona; and it is in Italy that the story is told
of the simple man who was found weeping in the
market-place; a professional story-teller had just
come to the death of Roland and the poor man heard
the news for the first time. A traveller in the Faroe
Islands not long ago, asking in the bookshop at
Thorshavn for some things in the Faroese language,
was offered a ballad of Roncesvalles.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<p>The favourite story everywhere was <i>Sir Ferabras</i>,
because the centre of the plot is the encounter between
Oliver the Paladin and Ferabras the Paynim champion.
Every one could understand this, and in all countries
the story became popular as a sound religious romance.</p>
<p>Naturally, the stories of action and adventure went
further and were more widely appreciated than the
cultivated sentimental romance. The English in the
reign of Edward I or Edward III had often much
difficulty in understanding what the French romantic
school was driving at&mdash;particularly when it seemed to
be driving round and round, spinning long monologues
of afflicted damsels, or elegant conversations full of
phrases between the knight and his lady. The
difficulty was not unreasonable. If the French authors
had been content to write about nothing but sentimental
conversations and languishing lovers, then one would
have known what to do. The man who is looking at
the railway bookstall for a good detective story knows
at once what to say when he is offered the Diary of a
Soul. But the successful French novelists of the
twelfth century appealed to both tastes, and dealt
equally in sensation and sentiment; they did not often
limit themselves to what was always their chief interest,
the moods of lovers. They worked these into plots of
adventure, mystery, fairy magic; the adventures were
too good to be lost; so the less refined English readers,
who were puzzled or wearied by sentimental conversations,
were not able to do without the elegant
romances. They read them; and they skipped. The
skipping was done for them, generally, when the
romances were translated into English; the English
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
versions are shorter than the French in most cases
where comparison is possible. As a general rule, the
English took the adventurous sensational part of
the French romances, and let the language of the heart
alone. To this there are exceptions. In the first
place it is not always true that the French romances are
adventurous. Some of them are almost purely love-stories&mdash;sentiment
from beginning to end. Further,
it is proved that one of these, <i>Amadas et Ydoine</i>&mdash;a
French romance written in England&mdash;was much liked
in England by many whose proper language was
English; there is no English version of it extant, and
perhaps there never was one, but it was certainly well
known outside the limited refined society for which
it was composed. And again there may be found
examples where the English adapter, instead of
skipping, sets himself to wrestle with the original&mdash;saying
to himself, &lsquo;I will <i>not</i> be beaten by this culture;
I will get to the end of it and lose nothing; it shall be
made to go into the English language&rsquo;. An example
of this effort is the alliterative romance of <i>William and
the Werwolf</i>, a work which does not fulfil the promise
of its title in any satisfactory way. It spends enormous
trouble over the sentimental passages of the original,
turning them into the form worst suited to them, viz.
the emphatic style of the alliterative poetry which is so
good for battle pieces, satire, storms at sea, and generally
everything except what it is here applied to. Part
of the success of Chaucer and almost all the beauty of
Gower may be said to be their mastery of French
polite literature, and their power of expressing in
English everything that could be said in French,
<span class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
with no loss of effect and no inferiority in manner.
Gower ought to receive his due alongside of Chaucer
as having accomplished what many English writers
had attempted for two hundred years before him&mdash;the
perfect adoption in English verse of everything
remarkable in the style of French poetry.</p>
<p>The history of narrative poetry is generally easier
than the history of lyric, partly because the subjects
are more distinct and more easily traceable. But it is
not difficult to recognize the enormous difference
between the English songs of the fourteenth century
and anything known to us in Anglo-Saxon verse,
while the likeness of English to French lyrical measures
in the later period is unquestionable. The difficulty
is that the history of early French lyric poetry is itself
obscure and much more complicated than the history
of narrative. Lyric poetry flourished at popular
assemblies and festivals, and was kept alive in oral
tradition much more easily than narrative poetry was.
Less of it, in proportion, was written down, until it
was taken up by ambitious poets and composed in a
more elaborate way.</p>
<p>The distinction between popular and cultivated
lyric is not always easy to make out, as any one may
recognize who thinks of the songs of Burns and attempts
to distinguish what is popular in them from what is
consciously artistic. But the distinction is a sound
one, and especially necessary in the history of medieval
literature&mdash;all the more because the two kinds often
pass into one another.</p>
<p>A good example is the earliest English song, as it is
sometimes called, which is very far from the earliest&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Sumer is icumen in</p>
<p class="t0">lhude sing cuccu.</p>
</div>
<p>It sounds like a popular song; an anonymous poem
from the heart of the people, in simple, natural,
spontaneous verse. But look at the original copy.
The song is written, of course, for music. And the
Cuckoo song is said by the historians of music to be
remarkable and novel; it is the first example of a
canon; it is not an improvisation, but the newest
kind of art, one of the most ingenious things of its
time. Further, the words that belong to it are Latin
words, a Latin hymn; the Cuckoo song, which appears
so natural and free, is the result of deliberate study;
syllable for syllable, it corresponds to the Latin, and
to the notes of the music.</p>
<p>Is it then <i>not</i> to be called a popular song? Perhaps
the answer is that all popular poetry, in Europe at
any rate for the last thousand years, is derived from
poetry more or less learned in character, or, like the
Cuckoo song, from more or less learned music. The
first popular songs of the modern world were the
hymns of St. Ambrose, and the oldest fashion of
popular tunes is derived from the music of the
Church.</p>
<p>The learned origin of popular lyric may be illustrated
from any of the old-fashioned broadsheets of the
street ballad-singers: for example <i>The Kerry Recruit</i>&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">As I was going up and down, one day in the month of August,</p>
<p class="t0">All in the town of sweet Tralee, I met the recruiting serjeant&mdash;</p>
</div>
<p>The metre of this is the same as in the <i>Ormulum</i>&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">This book is nemned Ormulum, for thy that Orm hit wrought&egrave;.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<p>It is derived through the Latin from the Greek; it
was made popular first through Latin rhyming verses
which were imitated in the vernacular languages,
Proven&ccedil;al, German, English. As it is a variety of
&lsquo;common metre&rsquo;, it is easily fitted to popular tunes,
and so it becomes a regular type of verse, both for
ambitious poets and for ballad-minstrels like the
author quoted above. It may be remembered that a
country poet wrote the beautiful song on Yarrow from
which Wordsworth took the verse of his own Yarrow
poems&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">But minstrel Burne cannot assuage</p>
<p class="t">His grief, while life endureth,</p>
<p class="t0">To see the changes of this age</p>
<p class="t">Which fleeting time procureth&mdash;</p>
</div>
<p>verse identical in measure with the <i>Ormulum</i>, and with
the popular Irish street ballad, and with many more.
So in the history of this type of verse we get the
following relations of popular and literary poetry:
first there is the ancient Greek verse of the same
measure; then there are the Latin learned imitations;
then there is the use of it by scholars in the Middle
Ages, who condescend to use it in Latin rhymes for
students&rsquo; choruses. Then comes the imitation of it
in different languages as in English by Orm and others
of his day (about 1200). It was very much in favour
then, and was used often irregularly, with a varying
number of syllables. But Orm writes it with perfect
accuracy, and the accurate type survived, and was just
as &lsquo;popular&rsquo; as the less regular kind. Minstrel Burne
is as regular as the <i>Ormulum</i>, and so, or very nearly as
much, is the anonymous Irish poet of The <i>Kerry Recruit</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<p>What happened in the case of the <i>Ormulum</i> verse is
an example of the whole history of modern lyric
poetry in its earlier period. Learned men like St.
Ambrose and St. Augustine wrote hymns for the
common people in Latin which the common people
of that time could understand. Then, in different
countries, the native languages were used to copy the
Latin measures and fit in to the same tunes&mdash;just as
the English Cuckoo song corresponds to the Latin
words for the same melody. Thus there were provided
for the new languages, as we may call them, a
number of poetical forms or patterns which could be
applied in all sorts of ways. These became common
and well understood, in the same manner as common
forms of music are understood, e.g. the favourite
rhythms of dance tunes; and like those rhythms they
could be adapted to any sort of poetical subject, and
used with all varieties of skill.</p>
<p>Many strange things happened while the new
rhyming sort of lyric poetry was being acclimatized in
England, and a study of early English lyrics is a good
introduction to all the rest of English poetry, because
in those days&mdash;in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries&mdash;may
be found the origin of the most enduring poetical
influences in later times.</p>
<p>One of the strange things was that the French lyrical
examples affected the English in two opposite ways.
As foreign verse, and as belonging especially to those
who were acquainted with courts and good society, it
had the attraction which fashionable and stylish things
generally have for those who are a little behind the
fashion. It was the newest and most brilliant thing;
<span class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
the English did all they could to make it their own
whether by composing in French themselves or by
copying the French style in English words. But
besides this fashionable and courtly value of French
poetry, there was another mode in which it appealed
to the English. Much of it was closely related not to
the courts but to popular country festivals which were
frequent also in towns, like the games and dances to
celebrate the coming of May. French poetry was
associated with games of that sort, and along with
games of that sort it came to England. The English
were hit on both sides. French poetry was more
genteel in some things, more popular and jovial in
others, than anything then current in England. Thus
the same foreign mode of composition which gave a
new courtly ideal to the English helped also very greatly
to quicken their popular life. While the distinction
between courtly and popular is nowhere more important
than in medieval literature, it is often very hard to
make it definite in particular cases, just for this reason.
It is not as if there were a popular native layer, English
in character and origin, with a courtly foreign French
layer above it. What is popular in Middle English
literature is just as much French as English; while,
on the other hand, what is native, like the alliterative
verse, is as often as not used for ambitious works.
<i>Sir Gawayne and the Greene Knight</i> and the poem of the
<i>Morte Arthure</i> are certainly not &lsquo;popular&rsquo; in the sense
of &lsquo;uneducated&rsquo; or &lsquo;simple&rsquo; or anything of that kind,
and though they are written in the old native verse
they are not intended for the people who had no
education and could not speak French.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>The great manifestation of French influence in the
common life of the Middle Ages was through the
fashion of the dance which generally went by the name
of <i>Carole</i>. The <i>carole</i>&mdash;music, verse and dance
altogether&mdash;spread as a fashion all over Europe in the
twelfth century; and there is nothing which so effectively
marks the change from the earlier to the later
Middle Ages. It <i>is</i> in fact a great part of the change,
with all that is implied in it; which may be explained
in the following way.</p>
<p>The <i>carole</i> was a dance accompanied by a song, the
song being divided between a leader and the rest of the
chorus; the leader sang the successive new lines, while
the rest of the dancers holding hands in a ring all
joined in the refrain. Now this was the fashion most
in favour in all gentle houses through the Middle Ages,
and it was largely through this that the French type
of lyric was transported to so many countries and
languages. French lyric poetry was part of a graceful
diversion for winter evenings in a castle or for summer
afternoons in the castle garden. But it was also
thoroughly and immediately available for all the
parish. In its origin it was popular in the widest
sense&mdash;not restricted to any one rank or class; and
though it was adopted and elaborated in the stately
homes of England and other countries it could not lose
its original character. Every one could understand it
and enjoy it; so it became the favourite thing at
popular festivals, as well as at the Christmas entertainments
in the great hall. Particularly, it was a favourite
custom to dance and sing in this way on the vigils or
eves of Saints&rsquo; days, when people assembled from some
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
distance at the church where the day was to be observed.
Dancing-parties were frequent at these &lsquo;wakes&rsquo;; they
were often held in the churchyard. There are many
stories to show how they were discouraged by the
clergy, and how deplorable was their vanity: but those
moral examples also prove how well established the
custom was; some of them also from their date show
how quickly it had spread. The best is in Giraldus
Cambrensis, &lsquo;Gerald the Welshman&rsquo;, a most amusing
writer, who is unfortunately little read, as he wrote in
Latin. In his <i>Gemma Ecclesiastica</i> he has a chapter
against the custom of using churches and churchyards
for songs and dances. As an illustration, he tells the
story of a wake in a churchyard, somewhere in the
diocese of Worcester, which was kept up all night long,
the dancers repeating one refrain over and over; so
that the priest who had this refrain in his ears all night
could not get rid of it in the morning, but repeated it
at the Mass&mdash;saying (instead of <i>Dominus vobiscum</i>)
&lsquo;Sweet Heart, have pity!&rsquo; Giraldus, writing in Latin,
quotes the English verse: <i>Swete lemman, thin ar&egrave;</i>. <i>Are</i>,
later <i>ore</i>, means &lsquo;mercy&rsquo; or &lsquo;grace&rsquo;, and the refrain is
of the same sort as is found, much later, in the lyric
poetry of the time of Edward I. Giraldus wrote in the
twelfth century, in the reign of Henry II, and it is plain
from what he tells that the French fashion was already
in full swing and as thoroughly naturalized among
the English as the Waltz or the Lancers in the nineteenth
century. The same sort of evidence comes
from Denmark about the same time as Giraldus; ring-dances
were equally a trouble and vexation to religious
teachers there&mdash;for, strangely, the dances seem everywhere
<span class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
to have been drawn to churches and monasteries,
through the custom of keeping religious wakes in a
cheerful manner. Europe was held together in this
common vanity, and it was through the <i>caroles</i> and
similar amusements that the poetical art of France
came to be dominant all over the North, affecting the
popular and unpretending poets no less than those of
greater ambition and conceit.</p>
<p>The word &lsquo;Court&rsquo; and its derivations are frequently
used by medieval and early modern writers with a
special reference to poetry. The courts of kings and
great nobles were naturally associated with the ideas of
polite education; those men &lsquo;that has used court and
dwelled therein can Frankis and Latin&rsquo;, says Richard
Rolle of Hampole in the fourteenth century; the
&lsquo;courtly maker&rsquo; is an Elizabethan name for the accomplished
poet, and similar terms are used in other
languages to express the same meaning. This &lsquo;courtly&rsquo;
ideal was not properly realized in England till the time
of Chaucer and Gower; and a general view of the
subject easily leads one to think of the English language
as struggling in the course of three centuries to get rid
of its homeliness, its rustic and parochial qualities.
This period, from about 1100 to 1400, closes in the full
attainment of the desired end. Chaucer and Gower are
unimpeachable as &lsquo;courtly makers&rsquo;, and their success
in this way also implies the establishment of their
language as pure English; the competition of dialects
is ended by the victory of the East Midland language
which Chaucer and Gower used. The &lsquo;courtly poets&rsquo;
make it impossible in England to use any language for
poetry except their own.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</div>
<p>But the distinction between &lsquo;courtly&rsquo; and &lsquo;vulgar&rsquo;,
&lsquo;popular&rsquo;, or whatever the other term may be, is not
very easy to fix. The history of the <i>carole</i> is an
example of this difficulty. The <i>carole</i> flourishes
among the gentry and it is a favourite amusement as
well among the common people. &lsquo;Courtly&rsquo; ideas,
suggestions, phrases, might have a circulation in
country places, and be turned to literary effect by
authors who had no special attachment to good society.
A hundred years before Chaucer there may be found
in the poem of <i>The Owl and the Nightingale</i>, written
in the language of Dorset, a kind of good-humoured
ironical satire which is very like Chaucer&rsquo;s own. This
is the most <i>modern</i> in tone of all the thirteenth-century
poems, but there are many others in which the rustic,
or popular, and the &lsquo;courtly&rsquo; elements are curiously
and often very pleasantly mixed.</p>
<p>In fact, for many purposes even of literary history
and criticism the medieval distinction between &lsquo;courtly&rsquo;
and popular may be neglected. There is always a
difficulty in finding out what is meant by &lsquo;the People&rsquo;.
One has only to remember Chaucer&rsquo;s Pilgrims to
understand this, and to realize how absurd is any fixed
line of division between ranks, with regard to their
literary taste. The most attentive listener and the
most critical among the Canterbury Pilgrims is the
Host of the Tabard. There was &lsquo;culture&rsquo; in the
Borough as well as in Westminster. The Franklin
who apologizes for his want of rhetorical skill&mdash;he had
never read Tullius or Cicero&mdash;tells one of the &lsquo;Breton
lays&rsquo;, a story elegantly planned and finished, of the
best French type; and the Wife of Bath, after the story
<span class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
of her own life, repeats another romance of the same
school as the Franklin&rsquo;s Tale. The average &lsquo;reading
public&rsquo; of Chaucer&rsquo;s time could understand a great
many different varieties of verse and prose.</p>
<p>But while the difference between &lsquo;courtly&rsquo; and
&lsquo;popular&rsquo; is often hard to determine in particular cases,
it is none the less important and significant in medieval
history. It implies the chivalrous ideal&mdash;the self-conscious
withdrawal and separation of the gentle
folk from all the rest, not merely through birth and
rank and the fashion of their armour, but through their
ways of thinking, and especially through their theory
of love. The devotion of the true knight to his lady&mdash;the
motive of all the books of chivalry&mdash;began to be the
favourite subject in the twelfth century; it was studied
and meditated in all manner of ways, and it is this that
gives its character to all the most original, as well as
to the most artificial, poetry of the later Middle Ages.
The spirit and the poetical art of the different nations
may be estimated according to the mode in which they
appropriated those ideas. For the ideas of this religion
of chivalrous love were <i>literary</i> and <i>artistic</i> ideas; they
went along with poetical ambitions and fresh poetical
invention&mdash;they led to the poetry of Dante, Petrarch
and Spenser, not as ideas and inspirations simply, but
through their employment of definite poetical forms
of expression, which were developed by successive
generations of poets.</p>
<p>Stories of true love do not belong peculiarly to the
age of chivalrous romance. The greatest of them all,
the story of Sigurd and Brynhild, has come down from
an older world. The early books of the Danish
<span class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
History of Saxo Grammaticus are full of romantic
themes. &lsquo;A mutual love arose between Hedin and
Hilda, the daughter of Hogne, a maiden of most
eminent renown. For though they had not yet seen
one another, each had been kindled by the other&rsquo;s
glory. But when they had a chance of beholding one
another, neither could look away; so steadfast was the
love that made their eyes linger&rsquo;. This passage
(quoted from Oliver Elton&rsquo;s translation) is one of the
things which were collected by Saxo from Danish
tradition; it is quite independent of anything chivalrous,
in the special sense of that word. Again, Chaucer&rsquo;s
<i>Legend of Good Women</i>, the story of Dido, or of
Pyramus and Thisbe, may serve as a reminder how
impossible it is to separate &lsquo;romantic&rsquo; from &lsquo;classical&rsquo;
literature. A great part of medieval romance is
nothing but a translation into medieval forms, into
French couplets, of the passion of Medea or of Dido.
Even in the fresh discovery which made the ideal of the
&lsquo;courtly&rsquo; schools, namely, the lover&rsquo;s worship of his
lady as divine, there is something traceable to the Latin
poets. But it was a fresh discovery, for all that, a new
mode of thought, whatever its source might be. The
devotion of Dante to Beatrice, of Petrarch to Laura, is
different from anything in classical poetry, or in the
earlier Middle Ages. It is first in Proven&ccedil;al lyric verse
that something like their ideas may be found; both
Dante and Petrarch acknowledge their debt to the
Proven&ccedil;al poets.</p>
<p>Those ideas can be expressed in lyric poetry; not
so well in narrative. They are too vague for narrative,
and too general; they are the utterance of any true
<span class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
lover, his pride and his humility, his belief that all the
joy and grace of the world, and of Heaven also, are
included in the worshipful lady. There is also along
with this religion a firm belief that it is not intended
for the vulgar; and as the ideas and motives are noble
so must the poetry be, in every respect. The refinement
of the idea requires a corresponding beauty of
form; and the lyric poets of Provence and their
imitators in Germany, the Minnesingers, were great
inventors of new stanzas and, it should be remembered,
of the tunes that accompanied them. It was
not allowable for one poet to take another poet&rsquo;s stanza.
The new spirit of devotion in love-poetry produced
an enormous variety of lyrical measures, which are still
musical, and some of them still current, to this day.</p>
<p>It was an artificial kind of poetry, in different senses
of the term. It was consciously artistic, and ambitious;
based upon science&mdash;the science of music&mdash;and deliberately
planned so as to make the best effect. The poets
were competitors&mdash;sometimes in actual competition
for a prize, as in the famous scene at the Wartburg,
which comes in <i>Tannh&auml;user</i>, or as at a modern Welsh
<i>eisteddfod</i>; the fame of a poet could not be gained
without the finest technical skill, and the prize was
often given for technical skill, rather than for anything
else. Besides this, the ideas themselves were conventional;
the poet&rsquo;s amatory religion was often assumed;
he chose a lady to whom he offered his poetical homage.
The fiction was well understood, and was highly
appreciated as an honour, when the poetry was
successful. For example, the following may be taken
from the Lives of the Troubadours&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<p>&lsquo;Richard of Barbezieux the poet fell in love with a
lady, the wife of a noble lord. She was gentle and fair,
and gay and gracious, and very desirous of praise and
honour; daughter of Jeffrey Rudel, prince of Blaye.
And when she knew that he loved her, she made him
fair semblance of love, so that he got hardihood to
plead his suit to her. And she with gracious countenance
of love treasured his praise of her, and accepted
and listened, as a lady who had good will of a poet
to make verses about her. And he composed his
songs of her, and called her <i>Mielhs de Domna</i> (&lsquo;Sovran
Lady&rsquo;) in his verse. And he took great delight in
finding similitudes of beasts and birds and men in his
poetry, and of the sun and the stars, so as to give new
arguments such as no poet had found before him.
Long time he sang to her; but it was never believed
that she yielded to his suit.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Proven&ccedil;al poetry cannot be shown to have had any
direct influence upon English, which is rather strange
considering the close relations between England and
the districts where the Proven&ccedil;al language&mdash;the <i>langue
d&rsquo;oc</i>&mdash;was spoken. It had great indirect influence,
through the French. The French imitated the Proven&ccedil;al
lyric poetry, as the Germans and the Italians
did, and by means of the French poets the Proven&ccedil;al
ideas found their way to England. But this took a
long time. The Proven&ccedil;al poets were &lsquo;courtly
makers&rsquo;; so were the French who copied them. The
&lsquo;courtly maker&rsquo; needs not only great houses and polite
society for his audience; not only the fine philosophy
&lsquo;the love of honour and the honour of love&rsquo;, which is
the foundation of chivalrous romance. Besides all
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
this, he needs the reward and approbation of success
in poetical art; he cannot thrive as an anonymous poet.
And it is not till the time of Chaucer and Gower that
there is found in England any poet making a great
name for himself as a master of the art of poetry, like
the Proven&ccedil;al masters Bernart de Ventadour or Arnaut
Daniel in the twelfth century, or like the German
Walther von der Vogelweide at the beginning of the
thirteenth.</p>
<p>Lyric poetry of the Proven&ccedil;al kind was a most
exacting and difficult art; it required very peculiar
conditions before it could flourish and be appreciated,
and those conditions did not exist in England or in the
English language. At the same time the elaborate
lyrics of Provence, like those of the Minnesingers in
Germany, are pretty closely related to many &lsquo;popular&rsquo;
forms and motives. Besides the idealist love-poetry
there were other kinds available&mdash;simple songs of
lament, or of satire&mdash;comic songs&mdash;lyrics with a scene
in them, such as the very beautiful one about the girl
whose lover has gone on the Crusade. In such as
these, though they have little directly to do with English
poetry, may be found many illustrations of English
modes of verse, and rich examples of that most delightful
sort of poetry which refuses to be labelled either
&lsquo;courtly&rsquo; or &lsquo;popular&rsquo;.</p>
<p>In French literature, as distinct from Proven&ccedil;al,
there was a &lsquo;courtly&rsquo; strain which flourished in the
same general conditions as the Proven&ccedil;al, but was
not so hard to understand and had a much greater
immediate effect on England.</p>
<p>The French excelled in narrative poetry. There
<span class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
seems to have been a regular exchange in poetry
between the South and the North of France. French
stories were translated into Proven&ccedil;al, Proven&ccedil;al lyrics
were imitated in the North of France. Thus French
lyric is partly Proven&ccedil;al in character, and it is in this
way that the Proven&ccedil;al influence is felt in English
poetry. The French narrative poetry, though it also
is affected by ideas from the South, is properly French
in origin and style. It is by means of narrative that
the French ideal of courtesy and chivalry is made
known, to the French themselves as well as to other
nations.</p>
<p>In the twelfth century a considerable change was
made in French poetry by the rise and progress of a
new romantic school in succession to the old <i>chansons
de geste</i>&mdash;the epic poems on the &lsquo;matter of France&rsquo;.
The old epics went down in the world, and gradually
passed into the condition of merely &lsquo;popular&rsquo; literature.
Some of them survive to this day in roughly printed
editions, like the <i>Reali di Francia</i>, which is an Italian
prose paraphrase of old French epics, and which
seems to have a good sale in the markets of Italy still,
as <i>The Seven Champions of Christendom</i> used to have in
England, and <i>The Four Sons of Aymon</i> in France.
The decline of the old epics began in the twelfth century
through the competition of more brilliant new
romances.</p>
<p>The subjects of these were generally taken either
from the &lsquo;matter of Britain&rsquo;, or from antiquity, the
&lsquo;matter of Rome the Great&rsquo;, which included Thebes and
Troy. The new romantic school wanted new subjects,
and by preference foreign subjects. This, however,
<span class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
was of comparatively small importance; it had long
been usual for story-tellers to go looking for subjects
to foreign countries; this is proved by the Saints&rsquo; Lives,
and also by the story of Alexander the Great, which
appeared in French before the new school was properly
begun.</p>
<p>In form of verse the new romances generally differed
from the <i>chansons de geste</i>, but this again is not an
exact distinction. Apart from other considerations,
the distinction fails because the octosyllabic rhyming
measure, the short couplet, which was the ordinary
form for fashionable romances, was also at the same
time the ordinary form for everything else&mdash;for
history, for moral and didactic poetry, and for comic
stories like Reynard the Fox. The establishment of
this &lsquo;short verse&rsquo; (as the author of <i>Hudibras</i> calls it) in
England is one of the most obvious and one of the
largest results of the literary influence of France, but
it is not specially due to the romantic school.</p>
<p>The character of that school must be sought much
more in its treatment of motives, and particularly
in its use of sentiment. It is romantic in its fondness
for strange adventures; but this taste is nothing new.
The real novelty and the secret of its greatest success
was its command of pathos, more especially in the
pathetic monologues and dialogues of lovers. It is
greatly indebted for this, as has been already remarked,
to the Latin poets. The <i>Aeneid</i> is turned into a
French romance (<i>Roman d&rsquo;Eneas</i>); and the French
author of the <i>Roman de Troie</i>, who gives the story of
the Argonauts in the introductory part of his work,
has borrowed much from Ovid&rsquo;s Medea in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
<i>Metamorphoses</i>. Virgil&rsquo;s Dido and Ovid&rsquo;s Medea had
an immense effect on the imagination of the French
poets and their followers. From Virgil and Ovid the
medieval authors got the suggestion of passionate
eloquence, and learned how to manage a love-story
in a dramatic way&mdash;allowing the characters free scope
to express themselves fully. Chivalrous sentiment
in the romances is partly due to the example of the
Latin authors, who wrote long passionate speeches for
their heroines, or letters like that of Phyllis to Demophoon
or Ariadne to Theseus and the rest of Ovid&rsquo;s
<i>Heroides</i>&mdash;the source of Chaucer&rsquo;s <i>Legend of Good
Women</i>. The idea of the lover as the servant of his
mistress was also taken first of all from the Latin
amatory poets. And the success of the new romantic
school was gained by the working together of those
ideas and examples, the new creation of chivalrous and
courteous love out of those elements.</p>
<p>The ideas are the same in the lyric as in the narrative
poetry; and it is allowable to describe a large part of
the French romantic poems as being the expression in
narrative of the ideas which had been lyrically uttered
in the poetry of Provence&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The love of honour and the honour of love.</p>
</div>
<p>The well-known phrase of Sidney is the true rendering
of the Proven&ccedil;al spirit; it is found nearly in the same
form in the old language&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Quar non es joys, si non l&rsquo;adutz honors,</p>
<p class="t0">Ni es honors, si non l&rsquo;adutz amors.</p>
</div>
<p>(There is no joy, if honour brings it not; nor is there
honour, if love brings it not.)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<p>The importance of all this for the history of Europe
can scarcely be over-estimated. It was the beginning
of a classical renaissance through the successful
appropriation of classical ideas in modern languages
and modern forms. It is true that the medieval
version of the <i>Aeneid</i> or of the story of the Argonauts
may appear exceedingly quaint and &lsquo;Gothic&rsquo; and
childish, if it be thought of in comparison with the
original; but if it be contrasted with the style of
narrative which was in fashion before it, the <i>Roman
d&rsquo;Eneas</i> comes out as something new and promising.
There is ambition in it, and the ambition is of the
same sort as has produced all the finer sentimental
fiction since. If it is possible anywhere to trace the
pedigree of fashions in literature, it is here. All
modern novelists are descended from this French
romantic poetry of the twelfth century, and therefore
from the classical poets to whom so much of the life
of the French romances can be traced. The great
poets of the Renaissance carry on in their own way
the processes of adaptation which were begun in the
twelfth century, and, besides that, many of them are
directly indebted&mdash;Ariosto and Spenser, for example&mdash;to
medieval romance.</p>
<p>Further, all the chivalrous ideals of the modern
world are derived from the twelfth century. Honour
and loyalty would have thriven without the chivalrous
poets, as they had thriven before them in every nation
on earth. But it is none the less true that the tradition
of honour was founded for the sixteenth century and
the eighteenth and the present day in Europe by the
poets of the twelfth century.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<p>The poetical doctrine of love, which is so great a
part of chivalry, has had one effect both on civilization
in general and on particular schools of poetry which it is
hard to sum up and to understand. It is sometimes
a courtly game like that described in the life of the
troubadour quoted above; the lady pleased at the
honour paid her and ready to accept the poet&rsquo;s worship;
the lady&rsquo;s husband either amused by it all, or otherwise,
if not amused, at any rate prevented by the rules
of polite society from objecting; the poet enamoured
according to the same code of law, with as much
sincerity as that law and his own disposition might
allow; thoroughly occupied with his own craft of
verse and with the new illustrations from natural or
civil history by means of which he hoped to make a
name and go beyond all other poets. The difficulty
is to know how much there is of pretence and artifice
in the game. It is certain that the Proven&ccedil;al lyric
poetry, and the other poetry derived from it in other
languages, has many excellences besides the ingenious
repetition of stock ideas in cleverly varied patterns of
rhyme. The poets are not all alike, and the poems of
one poet are not all alike. The same poem of Bernart
de Ventadour contains a beautiful, true, fresh description
of the skylark singing and falling in the middle of
the song through pure delight in the rays of the sun;
and also later an image of quite a different sort: the
lover looking in the eyes of his mistress and seeing
himself reflected there is in danger of the same fate as
Narcissus, who pined away over his own reflection in
the well. Imagination and Fancy are blended and
interchanged in the troubadours as much as in any
<span class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
modern poet. But apart from all questions of their
value, there is no possible doubt that the Proven&ccedil;al
idealism is the source, though not the only source, to
which all the noblest lyric poetry of later times and
other nations may be referred for its ancestry. The
succession of schools (or whatever the right name may
be) can be traced with absolute certainty through
Dante and Petrarch in the fourteenth century to
Ronsard and Spenser in the sixteenth, and further still.</p>
<p>The society which invented good manners and the
theory of honour, which is at the beginning of all
modern poetry and of all novels as well, is often
slighted by modern historians. The vanity, the
artifice, the pedantry can easily be noted and dismissed.
The genius of the several writers is buried in the difficulty
and unfamiliarity of the old languages, even where
it has not been destroyed and lost in other ways. But
still the spirit of Proven&ccedil;al lyric and of old French
romance can be proved to be, at the very lowest
estimate, the beginning of modern civilization, as
distinct from the earlier Middle Ages.</p>

<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">CHAPTER IV</span>
<br />THE ROMANCES</h2>
<p>All through the time between the Norman Conquest
and Chaucer one feels that <i>the Court</i> is what determines
the character of poetry and prose. The English
writers almost always have to bear in mind their
inferiority to French, and it is possible to describe their
efforts during three centuries (1100-1400) as generally
directed towards the ideal of French poetry, a struggle
to realize in English what had been already achieved
in French, to make English literature polite.</p>
<p>In the history of the English romances this may be
tested in various ways. To begin with, there is the
fact that many writers living in England wrote French,
and that some French romances, not among the worst,
were composed in England. It can hardly be doubted
that such was the case with the famous love-story of
<i>Amadas and Ydoine</i>; it is certain that the romance of
<i>Ipomedon</i> was composed by an Englishman, Hue de
Rotelande. Those two works of fiction are, if not the
noblest, at any rate among the most refined of their
species; <i>Amadas and Ydoine</i> is as perfect a romance of
true love as <i>Amadis of Gaul</i> in later days&mdash;a history
which possibly derived the name of its hero from the
earlier Amadas. <i>Ipomedon</i> is equally perfect in another
way, being one of the most clever and successful
specimens of the conventionally elegant work which
was practised by imitative poets after the fashion had
been established. There is no better romance to look
<span class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
at in order to see what things were thought important
in the &lsquo;school&rsquo;, i.e. among the well-bred unoriginal
writers who had learned the necessary style of verse,
and who could turn out a showy piece of new work by
copying the patterns they had before them. Both
<i>Ipomedon</i> and <i>Amadas and Ydoine</i> are in the best
possible style&mdash;the genteelest of tunes. The fact is
clear, that in the twelfth century literary refinement
was as possible in England as in France, so long as one
used the French language.</p>
<p>It must not be supposed that everything written in
French, whether in France or England, was courtly or
refined. There is plenty of rough French written in
England&mdash;some of it very good, too, like the prose
story of Fulk Fitzwaryn, which many people would
find much more lively than the genteel sentimental
novels. But while French could be used for all
purposes, polite or rude, English was long compelled
to be rude and prevented from competing on equal
terms with the language of those &lsquo;who have used court&rsquo;.</p>
<p>It is very interesting to see how the English translated
and adapted the polite French poems, because
the different examples show so many different degrees
of ambition and capacity among the native English.
In the style of the English romances&mdash;of which there
are a great many varieties&mdash;one may read the history
of the people; the romances bring one into relation
with different types of mind and different stages of
culture. What happened to <i>Ipomedon</i> is a good illustration.
First there is the original French poem&mdash;a
romantic tale in verse written in the regular French
short couplets of octosyllabic lines&mdash;well and correctly
<span class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
written by a man of English birth. In this production
Hue de Rotelande, the author, meant to do his best
and to beat all other competitors. He had the right
sort of talent for this&mdash;not for really original imagination,
but for the kind of work that was most in fashion
in his time. He did not, like some other poets, look
for a subject or a groundwork in a Breton lay, or an
Arabian story brought from the East by a traveller;
instead of that he had read the most successful romances
and he picked out of them, here and there, what suited
him best for a new combination. He took, for example,
the idea of the lover who falls in love with a lady he has
never seen (an idea much older than the French
romantic school, but that does not matter, for the
present); he took the story of the proud lady won by
faithful service; he took from one of the Arthurian
romances another device which is older than any
particular literature, the champion appearing, disguised
in different colours, on three successive days.
In <i>Ipomedon</i>, of course, the days are days of tournament,
and the different disguises three several suits of armour.
The scene of the story is Apulia and Calabria, chosen
for no particular reason except perhaps to get away
from the scene of the British romances. The hero&rsquo;s
name, Hippomedon, is Greek, like the names in the
<i>Romance of Thebes</i>, like Palamon and Arcita, which are
taken from the Greek names Pal&aelig;mon and Archytas.
Everything is borrowed, and nothing is used clumsily.
<i>Ipomedon</i> is made according to a certain prescription,
and it is made exactly in the terms of the prescription&mdash;a
perfect example of the regular fashionable novel, well
entitled to its place in any literary museum. This
<span class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
successful piece was turned into English in at least two
versions. One of these imitates the original verse of
<i>Ipomedon</i>, it is written in the ordinary short couplets.
In every other respect it fails to represent the original.
It leaves things out, and spoils the construction, and
misses the point. It is one of our failures. The other
version is much more intelligent and careful; the
author really was doing as much as he could to render
his original truly. But he fails in his choice of verse;
he translates the French couplets of <i>Ipomedon</i> into a
form of stanza, like that which Chaucer burlesques in
<i>Sir Thopas</i>. It is a very good kind of stanza, and this
anonymous English poet manages it well. But it is
the wrong sort of measure for that kind of story. It
is a dancing, capering measure, and ill suited to
translate the French verse, which is quiet, sedate, and
not emphatic. These two translations show how the
English were apt to fail. Some of them were stupid,
and some of them had the wrong sort of skill.</p>
<p>It may be an accident that the English who were so
fond of translating from the French should (apparently)
have taken so little from the chief French poet of the
twelfth century. This was Chrestien de Troyes, who
was in his day everything that Racine was five hundred
years later; that is to say, he was the successful and
accomplished master of all the subtleties of emotion,
particularly of love, expressed in the newest, most
engaging and captivating style&mdash;the perfect manner of
good society. His fine narrative poems were thoroughly
appreciated in Germany, where German was
at that time the language of all the courts, and where
the poets of the land were favoured and protected in
<span class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
the same way as poets in France and Provence. In
English there is only one romance extant which is
translated from Chrestien de Troyes; and the character
of the translation is significant: it proves how
greatly the circumstances and conditions of literature
in England differed from those of France and Germany.
The romance is <i>Ywain and Gawain</i>, a translation of
Chrestien&rsquo;s <i>Yvain</i>, otherwise called <i>Le Chevalier au
Lion</i>. It is a good romance, and in style it is much
closer to the original than either of the two versions of
<i>Ipomedon</i>, lately mentioned; no other of the anonymous
romances comes so near to the standard of Chaucer and
Gower. It is good in manner; its short couplets (in
the language of the North of England) reproduce very
well the tone of French narrative verse. But the
English writer is plainly unable to follow the French in
all the effusive passages; he thinks the French is too
long, and he cuts down the speeches. On the other
hand (to show the difference between different
countries), the German translator Hartmann von Aue,
dealing with the same French poem, admires the same
things as the French author, and spins out his translation
to a greater length than the original. Another
historical fact of the same sort is that the English seem
to have neglected the <i>Roman d&rsquo;Eneas</i>; while German
historians note that it was a translation of this French
poem, the <i>Eneide</i> of Heinrich van Valdeke, which first
introduced the courteous literary form of romance into
Germany. German poetry about the year 1200 was
fully the equal of French, in the very qualities on
which the French authors prided themselves. England
was labouring far behind.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>It is necessary to judge England in comparison with
France, if the history of medieval poetry is to be written
and studied at all. But the comparison ought not to
be pressed so far as to obliterate all the genuine virtues
of the English writers because they are not the same
as the French. There is another consideration also
which ought not to be left out. It is true that the most
remarkable thing in the French romances was their
&lsquo;language of the heart&rsquo;, their skill in rendering passion
and emotion&mdash;their &lsquo;sensibility&rsquo;, to use an eighteenth-century
name for the same sort of disposition. But
this emotional skill, this ingenious use of passionate
language in soliloquies and dialogues, was not the only
attraction in the French romances. It was the most
important thing at the time, and historically it is what
gives those romances, of Chrestien de Troyes and
others, their rank among the poetical ideas of the world.
It was through their sensibility that they enchanted
their own time, and this was the spirit which passed
on from them to later generations through the prose
romances of the fourteenth century, such as <i>Amadis of
Gaul</i>, to those of the seventeenth century, such as the
<i>Grand Cyrus</i> or <i>Cassandra</i>. To understand what the
works of Chrestien de Troyes meant for his contemporaries
one cannot do better than read the letters in
which Dorothy Osborne speaks of her favourite
characters in the later French prose romances, those
&lsquo;monstrous fictions&rsquo;, as Scott called them, &lsquo;which
constituted the amusement of the young and the gay
in the age of Charles II&rsquo;. Writing to Sir William
Temple she says: &lsquo;Almanzor is as fresh in my memory
as if I had visited his tomb but yesterday. . . . You
<span class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
will believe I had not been used to great afflictions when
I made his story such an one to me as I cried an hour
together for him, and was so angry with Alcidiana that
for my life I could never love her after it&rsquo;. Almanzor
and Alcidiana, and the sorrows that so touched their
gentle readers in the age of Louis XIV and Charles II,
were the descendants of Chrestien de Troyes in a direct
line; they represent what is enduring and inexhaustible
in the spirit of the older polite literature in France.
Sentiment in modern fiction can be traced back to
Chrestien de Troyes. It is a fashion which was
established then and has never been extinguished since;
if there is to be any history of ideas at all, this is what
has to be recorded as the principal influence in French
literature in the twelfth century. But it was not
everything, and it was not a simple thing. There are
many varieties of sentiment, and besides sentiment
there are many other interests in the old French
romantic literature. The works of Chrestien de Troyes
may be taken as examples again. In one, <i>Cliges</i>, there
are few adventures; in <i>Perceval</i> (the story of the Grail),
his last poem, the adventures are many and wonderful.
In his <i>Lancelot</i>, the sentimental interest is managed in
accordance with the rules of the Proven&ccedil;al poetry at its
most refined and artificial height; but his story of
<i>Enid</i> is in substance the same as Tennyson&rsquo;s, a romance
which does not need (like Chrestien&rsquo;s <i>Lancelot</i>) any
study of a special code of behaviour to explain the
essence of it. The lovers here are husband and wife
(quite against the Proven&ccedil;al rules), and the plot is pure
comedy, a misunderstanding cleared away by the truth
and faithfulness of the heroine.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<p>Further, although it is true that adventure is not
the chief interest with Chrestien de Troyes and his
followers, it is not true that it is neglected by them;
and besides, although they were the most fashionable
and most famous and successful authors of romance,
they were not the only story-tellers nor was their
method the only one available. There was a form of
short story, commonly called <i>lai</i> and associated with
Brittany, in which there was room for the same kind of
matter as in many of the larger romances, but not for
the same expression and effusion of sentiment. The
best known are those of Marie de France, who
dedicated her book of stories to King Henry of
England (Henry II). One of the best of the English
short romances, <i>Sir Launfal</i>, is taken from Marie de
France; her stories have a beauty which was not at
the time so enthralling as the charm of the longer
stories, and which had nothing like the same influence
on the literature of the future, but which now, for
those who care to look at it, has much more freshness,
partly because it is nearer to the fairy mythology of
popular tradition. The longer romances are really
modern novels&mdash;studies of contemporary life, characters
and emotions, mixed up with adventures more
or less surprising. The shorter <i>lais</i> (like that of
<i>Sir Launfal</i>) might be compared to the stories of Hans
Christian Andersen; they are made in the same way.
Like many of Andersen&rsquo;s tales, they are borrowed from
folk-lore; like them, again, they are not mere transcripts
from an uneducated story-teller. They are &lsquo;old wives&rsquo;
tales&rsquo;, but they are put into fresh literary form. This
new form may occasionally interfere with something
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
in the original traditional version, but it does not, either
with Marie de France or with Andersen, add too much
to the original. Curiously, there is an example in
English, among the shorter rhyming romances, of a
story which Andersen has told in his own way under
the title of the <i>Travelling Companion</i>. The English
<i>Sir Amadace</i> is unfortunately not one of the best of the
short stories&mdash;not nearly as good as <i>Sir Launfal</i>&mdash;but
still it shows how a common folk-lore plot, the story
of the Grateful Dead, might be turned into literary
form without losing all its original force and without
being transformed into a mere vehicle for modern
literary ambitions.</p>
<p>The relations between folk-lore and literature are
forced on the attention when one is studying the Middle
Ages, and perhaps most of all in dealing with this
present subject, the romances of the age of chivalry.
In Anglo-Saxon literature it is much less to the fore,
probably not because there was little of it really, but
because so little has been preserved. In the eleventh
and twelfth centuries there was a great stirring-up of
popular mythology in a number of countries, so that
it came to be noticed, and passed into scores of books,
both in the form of plots for stories, and also in scientific
remarks made by investigators and historians. Giraldus
Cambrensis is full of folk-lore, and about the same
time Walter Map (in his <i>De Nugis Curialium</i>) and
Gervase of Tilbury (in his <i>Otia Imperialia</i>) were taking
notes of the same sort. Both Giraldus and Walter
Map were at home in Wales, and it was particularly
in the relation between the Welsh and their neighbours
that the study of folk-lore was encouraged; both the
<span class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
historical study, as in the works of these Latin authors
just named, and the traffic in stories to be used for
literary purposes in the vernacular languages whether
French or English.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;matter of Britain&rsquo; in the stories of Tristram,
Gawain, Perceval and Lancelot came to be associated
peculiarly with the courteous sentimental type of
romance which had such vogue and such influence
in the Middle Ages. But the value of this &lsquo;matter&rsquo;&mdash;the
Celtic stories&mdash;was by no means exclusively
connected with the ambitious literary art of Chrestien
and others like him. Apart from form altogether, it
counts for something that such a profusion of stories
was sent abroad over all the nations. They were
interesting and amusing, in whatever language they
were told. They quickened up people&rsquo;s imaginations
and gave them something to think about, in the same
way as the Italian novels which were so much read in
the time of Shakespeare, or the trashy German novels
in the time of Shelley.</p>
<p>It is much debated among historians whether it was
from Wales or Brittany that these stories passed into
general circulation. It seems most probable that the
two Welsh countries on both sides of the Channel gave
stories to their neighbours&mdash;to the Normans both in
France and England, and to the English besides on the
Welsh borders. It seems most probable at any rate
that the French had not to wait for the Norman
Conquest before they picked up any Celtic stories.
The Arthurian names in Italy (mentioned already
above, p. 50) are found too early, and the dates do not
allow time for the stories to make their way, and find
<span class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
favour, and tempt people in Lombardy to call their
children after Gawain instead of a patron saint. It is
certain that both in Brittany&mdash;Little Britain&mdash;and in
Wales King Arthur was a hero, whose return was to
put all things right. It was to fulfil this prophecy
that Geoffrey Plantagenet&rsquo;s son was called Arthur, and
a Proven&ccedil;al poet hails the child with these auspices:
&lsquo;Now the Bretons have got their Arthur&rsquo;. Other
writers speak commonly of the &lsquo;Breton folly&rsquo;&mdash;this
hope of a deliverer was the Breton vanity, well known
and laughed at by the more practical people across
the border.</p>
<p>Arthur, however, was not the proper hero of the
romantic tales, either in their shorter, more popular
form or in the elaborate work of the courtly school.
In many of the <i>lais</i> he is never mentioned; in most of
the romances, long or short, early or late, he has
nothing to do except to preside over the feast, at
Christmas or Whitsuntide, and wait for adventures.
So he is represented in the English poem of <i>Sir Gawayn
and the Grene Knyght</i>. The stories are told not about
King Arthur, but about Gawain or Perceval, Lancelot
or Pelleas or Pellenore.</p>
<p>The great exception to this general rule is the history
of Arthur which was written by Geoffrey of Monmouth
in the first half of the twelfth century as part of his
Latin history of Britain. This history of Arthur was
of course translated wherever Geoffrey was translated,
and sometimes it was picked out for separate treatment,
as by the remarkable author of the <i>Morte Arthure</i>, one
of the best of the alliterative poems. Arthur had long
been known in Britain as a great leader against the
<span class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
Saxon invaders; Geoffrey of Monmouth took up and
developed this idea in his own way, making Arthur a
successful opponent not of the Saxons merely but of
Rome; a conqueror of kingdoms, himself an emperor
before whom the power of Rome was humbled. In
consequence of which the &lsquo;Saxons&rsquo; came to think of
their country as Britain, and to make Arthur their
national hero, in the same way as Charlemagne was
the national hero in France. Arthur also, like Charlemagne,
came to be generally respected all over
Christendom, in Norway and Iceland, as well as Italy
and Greece. Speaking generally, whenever Arthur is
a great conquering hero like Alexander or Charlemagne
this idea of him is due to Geoffrey of Monmouth; the
stories where he only appears as holding a court and
sending out champions are stories that have come
from popular tradition, or are imitations of such stories.
But there are some exceptions. For one thing,
Geoffrey&rsquo;s representation of Arthur is not merely a
composition after the model of Alexander the Great or
Charlemagne; the story of Arthur&rsquo;s fall at the hands
of his nephew is traditional. And when Layamon
a &lsquo;Saxon&rsquo; turned the French rhyming version of
Geoffrey into English&mdash;Layamon&rsquo;s <i>Brut</i>&mdash;he added a
number of things which are neither in the Latin nor
the French, but obtained by Layamon himself independently,
somehow or other, from the Welsh.
Layamon lived on the banks of the Severn, and very
probably he may have done the same kind of note-taking
in Wales or among Welsh acquaintances as was
done by Walter Map a little earlier. Layamon&rsquo;s
additions are of great worth; he tells the story of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
passing of Arthur, and it is from Layamon, ultimately,
that all the later versions&mdash;Malory&rsquo;s and Tennyson&rsquo;s&mdash;are
derived.</p>
<p>None of the English authors can compete with the
French poets as elegant writers dealing with contemporary
manners. But apart from that kind of work
almost every variety of interest may be found in the
English stories. There are two, <i>King Horn</i> and
<i>Havelok the Dane</i>, which appear to be founded on
national English traditions coming down from the
time of the Danish wars. <i>King Horn</i> is remarkable
for its metre&mdash;short rhyming couplets, but not in the
regular eight-syllable lines which were imitated from
the French. The verse appears to be an adaptation
of the old native English measure, fitted with regular
rhymes. Rhyme was used in continental German
poetry, and in Icelandic, and occasionally in Anglo-Saxon,
before there were any French examples to
follow; and <i>King Horn</i> is one thing surviving to show
how the English story-tellers might have got on if they
had not paid so much attention to the French authorities
in rhyme. The story of Havelok belongs to the town
of Grimsby particularly and to the Danelaw, the
district of England occupied by Danish settlers. The
name Havelok is the Danish, or rather the Norwegian,
Anlaf or Olaf, and the story seems to be a tradition in
which two historical Olafs have been confused&mdash;one
the Olaf who was defeated at the battle of Brunanburh,
the other the Olaf who won the battle of Maldon&mdash;Olaf
Tryggvason, King of Norway. <i>Havelok</i>, the
English story, is worth reading as a good specimen of
popular English poetry in the thirteenth century, a
<span class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
story where the subject and the scene are English,
where the manners are not too fine, and where the
hero, a king&rsquo;s son disinherited and unrecognized, lives
as a servant for a long time and so gives the author
a chance of describing common life and uncourtly
manners. And he does this very well, particularly in
the athletic sports where Havelok distinguishes himself&mdash;an
excellent piece to compare with the funeral
games which used to be a necessary part of every
regular epic poem. <i>Horn</i> and <i>Havelok</i>, though they
belong to England, are scarcely to be reckoned as part
of the &lsquo;matter of Britain&rsquo;, at least as that was understood
by the French author who used the term. There
are other stories which will not go easily into that or
into either of the two other divisions. One of these is
the story of <i>Floris and Blanchefleur</i>, which was turned
into English in the thirteenth century&mdash;one of the
oldest among the rhyming romances. This is one of
the many stories that came from the East. It is the
history of two young lovers who are separated for a
time&mdash;a very well known and favourite type of story.
This is the regular plot in the Greek prose romances,
such as that of Heliodorus which was so much admired
after the Renaissance. This story of <i>Floris and
Blanchefleur</i>, however, does not come from Greece,
but from the same source as the <i>Arabian Nights</i>.
Those famous stories, the Thousand and One Nights,
were not known in Europe till the beginning of the
eighteenth century, but many things of the same sort
had made their way in the Middle Ages into France,
and this was the best of them all. It is found in
German and Dutch, as well as in English; also in
<span class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
Swedish and Danish, in the same kind of short
couplets&mdash;showing how widely the fashions of literature
were prescribed by France among all the Teutonic
races.</p>
<p>How various the styles of romance might be is
shown by two poems which are both found in the
famous <i>Auchinleck</i> manuscript in Edinburgh, <i>Sir
Orfeo</i> and <i>Sir Tristrem</i>. The stories are two of the
best known in the world. <i>Sir Orfeo</i> is Orpheus. But
this version of Orpheus and Eurydice is not a translation
from anything classical; it is far further from any
classical original than even the very free and distinctly
&lsquo;Gothic&rsquo; rendering of Jason and Medea at the beginning
of the old French tale of Troy. The story of Orpheus
has passed through popular tradition before it turns
into <i>Sir Orfeo</i>. It shows how readily folk-lore will
take a suggestion from book-learning, and how easily
it will make a classical fable into the likeness of a
Breton lay. Orfeo was a king, and also a good harper:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">He hath a queen full fair of price</p>
<p class="t0">That is clep&egrave;d Dame Erodys.</p>
</div>
<p>One day in May Queen Erodys slept in her orchard,
and when she awoke was overcome with affliction
because of a dream&mdash;a king had appeared to her, with
a thousand knights and fifty ladies, riding on snow-white
steeds.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The king had a crown on his head</p>
<p class="t0">It was no silver, ne gold red,</p>
<p class="t0">All it was of precious stone,</p>
<p class="t0">As bright as sun forsooth it shone.</p>
</div>
<p>He made her ride on a white palfrey to his own land,
and showed her castles and towers, meadows, fields
<span class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
and forests; then he brought her home, and told her
that the next day she would be taken away for ever.</p>
<p>The king kept watch on the morrow with two
hundred knights; but there was no help; among them
all she was fetched away &lsquo;with the faerie&rsquo;. Then King
Orfeo left his kingdom, and went out to the wilderness
to the &lsquo;holtes hoar&rsquo; barefoot, taking nothing of all his
wealth but his harp only.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">In summer he liveth by haw&egrave;s</p>
<p class="t0">That on hawthorne groweth by shaw&egrave;s,</p>
<p class="t0">And in winter by root and rind</p>
<p class="t0">For other thing may he none find.</p>
<p class="t0">No man could tell of his sore</p>
<p class="t0">That he suffered ten year and more,</p>
<p class="t0">He that had castle and tower,</p>
<p class="t0">Forest, frith, both field and flower,</p>
<p class="t0">Now hath he nothing that him liketh</p>
<p class="t0">But wild beasts that by him striketh.</p>
</div>
<p>Beasts and birds came to listen to his harping&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">When the weather is clear and bright,</p>
<p class="t0">He taketh his harp anon right;</p>
<p class="t0">Into the wood it ringeth shrill</p>
<p class="t0">As he could harp&egrave; at his will:</p>
<p class="t0">The wild&egrave; best&egrave;s that there beth</p>
<p class="t0">For joy about him they geth</p>
<p class="t0">All the fowl&egrave;s that there were</p>
<p class="t0">They comen about him there</p>
<p class="t0">To hear harping that was fine</p>
<p class="t0">So mickle joy was therein.</p>
<p class="t2"><span class="gs"> .     .     .</span></p>
<p class="t0">Oft he saw him beside</p>
<p class="t0">In the hot&egrave; summer tide</p>
<p class="t0">The king of Fayr&eacute; with his rout</p>
<p class="t0">Came to hunt all about.</p>
<p class="t2"><span class="gs"> .     .     .</span></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<p>Sometimes he saw the armed host of the Faerie; sometimes
knights and ladies together, in bright attire,
riding an easy pace, and along with them all manner
of minstrelsy. One day he followed a company of the
Fairy ladies as they were hawking by the river (or
rather the <i>rivere</i>&mdash;i.e. the bank of the stream) at</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Pheasant heron and cormorant;</p>
<p class="t0">The fowls out of the river flew</p>
<p class="t0">Every falcon his game slew.</p>
</div>
<p>King Orfeo saw that and laughed and rose up from his
resting-place and followed, and found his wife among
them; but neither might speak with the other&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">But there might none with other speak</p>
<p class="t0">Though she him knew and he her, eke.</p>
</div>
<p>But he took up his harp and followed them fast, over
stock and stone, and when they rode into a hillside&mdash;&lsquo;in
at the roche&rsquo;&mdash;he went in after them.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">When he was into the roche y-go</p>
<p class="t0">Well three mile, and some deal mo</p>
<p class="t0">He came to a fair countray</p>
<p class="t0">Was as bright as any day.</p>
</div>
<p>There in the middle of a lawn he saw a fair high castle
of gold and silver and precious stones.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">No man might tell ne think in thought</p>
<p class="t0">The riches that therein was wrought.</p>
</div>
<p>The porter let him in, as a minstrel, and he was brought
before the king and queen. &lsquo;How do you come here?&rsquo;
said the king; &lsquo;I never sent for you, and never before
have I known a man so hardy as to come unbidden.&rsquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
Then Sir Orfeo put in a word for the minstrels; &lsquo;It is
our manner&rsquo;, he said, &lsquo;to come to every man&rsquo;s house
unbidden&rsquo;,</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&lsquo;And though we nought welcome be</p>
<p class="t0">Yet we must proffer our game or glee.&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Then he took his harp and played, and the king offered
him whatever he should ask.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&lsquo;Minstrel, me liketh well thy glee.&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Orfeo asked for the lady bright. &lsquo;Nay&rsquo;, said the king,
&lsquo;that were a foul match, for in her there is no blemish
and thou art rough and black&rsquo;. &lsquo;Fouler still&rsquo;, said
Orfeo, &lsquo;to hear a leasing from a king&rsquo;s mouth&rsquo;; and
the king then let him go with good wishes, and Orfeo
and Erodys went home. The steward had kept the
kingdom truly; &lsquo;thus came they out of care&rsquo;.</p>
<p>It is all as simple as can be; a rescue out of fairyland,
through the power of music; the ideas are found
everywhere, in ballads and stories. The ending is
happy, and nothing is said of the injunction not to look
back. It was probably left out when Orpheus was
turned into a fairy tale, on account of the power of
music; the heart of the people felt that Orpheus the
good harper ought not to be subjected to the common
plot. For there is nothing commoner in romance or
in popular tales than forgetfulness like that of Orpheus
when he lost Eurydice; the plot of <i>Sir Launfal</i> e.g.
turns on that; he was warned not to speak of his fairy
wife, but he was led, by circumstances over which he
had no control, to boast of her&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">To speke ne might&egrave; he forgo</p>
<p class="t">And said the queen before:</p>
<p class="t0">&lsquo;I have loved a fairer woman</p>
<p class="t0">Than thou ever laidest thine eye upon,</p>
<p class="t">This seven year and more!&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The drama of <i>Lohengrin</i> keeps this idea before the
public (not to speak of the opera of <i>Orfeo</i>), and
<i>Lohengrin</i> is a medieval German romance. The
Breton lay of Orpheus would not have been in any way
exceptional if it had kept to the original fable; the
beauty of it loses nothing by the course which it has
preferred to take, the happy ending. One may refer
to it as a standard, to show what can be done in the
medieval art of narrative, with the simplest elements
and smallest amount of decoration. It is minstrel
poetry, popular poetry&mdash;the point is clear when King
Orfeo excuses himself to the King of Faerie by the
rules of his profession as a minstrel; that was intended
to produce a smile, and applause perhaps, among the
audience. But though a minstrel&rsquo;s poem it is far
from rude, and it is quite free from the ordinary faults
of rambling and prosing, such as Chaucer ridiculed in
his <i>Geste of Sir Thopas</i>. It is all in good compass, and
coherent; nothing in it is meaningless or ill-placed.</p>
<p><i>Sir Tristrem</i> is a great contrast to <i>Sir Orfeo</i>; not an
absolute contrast, for neither is this story rambling or
out of compass. The difference between the two is
that <i>Sir Orfeo</i> is nearly perfect as an English representative
of the &lsquo;Breton lay&rsquo;&mdash;i.e. the short French
romantic story like the <i>Lais</i> of Marie de France; while
<i>Sir Tristrem</i> represents no French style of narrative
poetry, and is not very successful (though technically
<span class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
very interesting) as an original English experiment in
poetical form. It is distinctly clever, as it is likewise
ambitious. The poet intends to do finer things than
the common. He adopts a peculiar stanza, not one of
the easiest&mdash;a stanza more fitted for lyric than narrative
poetry, and which is actually used for lyrical verse by
the poet Laurence Minot. It is in short lines, well
managed and effective in their way, but it is a thin
tinkling music to accompany the tragic story.</p>

<p>The stage is that of a little neat puppet-show; with
figures like those of a miniature, dressed in bright
armour, or in scarlet and vair and grey&mdash;the rich cloth,
<span class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
the precious furs, grey and ermine, which so often
represent the glory of this world in the old romances&mdash;</p>

</div>
<p>There is a large group of rhyming romances which
might be named after Chaucer&rsquo;s <i>Sir Thopas</i>&mdash;the companions
of <i>Sir Thopas</i>. Chaucer&rsquo;s burlesque is easily
misunderstood. It is criticism, and it is ridicule; it
shows up the true character of the common minstrelsy;
the rambling narrative, the conventional stopgaps, the
complacent childish vanity of the popular artist who
has his audience in front of him and knows all the
easy tricks by which he can hold their attention.
Chaucer&rsquo;s <i>Rime of Sir Thopas</i> is interrupted by the
voice of common sense&mdash;rudely&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">This may well be rime doggerel, quoth he.</p>
</div>
<p>But Chaucer has made a good thing out of the rhyme
doggerel, and expresses the pleasant old-fashioned
quality of the minstrels&rsquo; romances, as well as their
absurdities.</p>
<p>His parody touches on the want of plan and method
and meaning in the popular rhymes of chivalry; it is
also intended as criticism of their verse. That verse,
of which there are several varieties&mdash;there is more
than one type of stanza in <i>Sir Thopas</i>&mdash;is technically
called <i>rime cou&eacute;e</i> or &lsquo;tail-rhyme&rsquo;, and like all patterns
of verse it imposes a certain condition of mind, for
the time, on the poets who use it. It is not absolutely
<span class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
simple, and so it is apt to make the writer well pleased
with himself when he finds it going well; it very
readily becomes monotonous and flat&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Now cometh the emperour of price,</p>
<p class="t0">Again him rode the king of Galice</p>
<p class="t2">With full mickle pride;</p>
<p class="t0">The child was worthy under weed</p>
<p class="t0">And sat upon a noble steed</p>
<p class="t2">By his father side;</p>
<p class="t0">And when he met the emperour</p>
<p class="t0">He valed his hood with great honour</p>
<p class="t2">And kissed him in that tide;</p>
<p class="t0">And other lords of great valour</p>
<p class="t0">They also kiss&egrave;d Segramour</p>
<p class="t2">In heart is not to hide.<span class="lnum">(<i>Emar&eacute;.</i>)</span></p>
</div>
<p>For that reason, because of the monotonous beat of the
tail-rhymes in the middle and at the end of the stanza,
it is chosen by the parodists of Wordsworth in the
<i>Rejected Addresses</i> when they are aiming at what they
think is flat and insipid in his poetry. But it is a form
of stanza which may be so used as to escape the
besetting faults; the fact that it has survived through
all the changes of literary fashion, and has been used
by poets in all the different centuries, is something to
the credit of the minstrels, as against the rude common-sense
criticism of the Host of the Tabard when he
stopped the Rime of <i>Sir Thopas</i>.</p>
<p>Chaucer&rsquo;s catalogue of romances is well known&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Men speken of romances of prys</p>
<p class="t0">Of Horn Child and of Ypotys</p>
<p class="t2">Of Bevis and Sir Gy,</p>
<p class="t0">Of Sir Libeux and Pleyndamour,</p>
<p class="t0">But Sir Thopas he bereth the flour</p>
<p class="t2">Of royal chivalry.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<p>In this summary, the name of <i>Pleyndamour</i> is still a
difficulty for historians; it is not known to what book
Chaucer was referring. <i>Ypotis</i> is curiously placed, for
the poem of <i>Ypotis</i> is not what is usually reckoned a
romance. &lsquo;Ypotis&rsquo; is Epictetus the Stoic philosopher,
and the poem is derived from the old moralizing
dialogue literature; it is related to the Anglo-Saxon
dialogue of Solomon and Saturn. The other four are
well known. <i>Horn Childe</i> is a later version, in stanzas,
of the story of <i>King Horn</i>. Bevis of Southampton and
Guy of Warwick are among the most renowned, and
most popular, of all the chivalrous heroes. In later
prose adaptations they were current down to modern
times; they were part of the favourite reading of
Bunyan, and gave him ideas for the <i>Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress</i>.
<i>Guy of Warwick</i> was rewritten many times&mdash;Chaucer&rsquo;s
pupil, Lydgate, took it up and made a new version of
it. There was a moral and religious strain in it, which
appealed to the tastes of many; the remarkable
didactic prose romance of <i>Tirant the White</i>, written in
Spain in the fifteenth century, is connected with <i>Guy
of Warwick</i>. Sir Bevis is more ordinary and has no
particular moral; it is worth reading, if any one wishes
to know what was regularly expected in romances by
the people who read, or rather who listened to them.
The disinherited hero, the beautiful Paynim princess,
the good horse Arundel, the giant Ascapart&mdash;these and
many other incidents may be paralleled in other stories;
the history of Sir Bevis has brought them all together,
and all the popular novelist&rsquo;s machinery might be fairly
catalogued out of this work alone.</p>
<p><i>Sir Libeaus</i>&mdash;Le Beau Desconnu, the Fair Knight
<span class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
unknown&mdash;is a different thing. This also belongs to
the School of Sir Thopas&mdash;it is minstrels&rsquo; work, and
does not pretend to be anything else. But it is well
done. The verse, which is in short measure like that
of <i>Sir Tristrem</i>, but not in so ambitious a stanza, is
well managed&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">That maide knelde in halle</p>

<p class="t">And seide: My lord Arthour!</p>

<p class="t0">Sche praith the sende her a knight</p>
<p class="t0">With herte good and light</p>
<p class="t">To winne her with honour.</p>
</div>
<p>This quotation came from the beginning of the story,
and it gives the one problem which has to be solved
by the hero. Instead of the mixed adventures of Sir
Bevis, there is only one principal one, which gives
occasion to all the adventures by the way. The lady of
Sinodoun has fallen into the power of two enchanters,
and her damsel (with her dwarf attendant) comes to the
court of King Arthur to ask for a champion to rescue
her. It is a story like that of the Red Cross Knight
and Una. If Sir Bevis corresponds to what one may
call the ordinary matter of Spenser&rsquo;s <i>Faerie Queen</i>, the
wanderings, the separations, the dangerous encounters,
<i>Sir Libeaus</i> resembles those parts of Spenser&rsquo;s story
where the plot is most coherent. One of the most
beautiful passages in all his work, Britomart in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
house of the enchanter Busirane, may have been
suggested by <i>Sir Libeaus. Sir Libeaus</i> is one example
of a kind of medieval story, not the greatest, but still
good and sound; the Arthurian romance in which
Arthur has nothing to do except to preside at the
beginning, and afterwards to receive the conquered
opponents whom the hero sends home from successive
stages in his progress, to make submission to the king.
Sir Libeaus (his real name is Guinglain, the son of
Gawain) sets out on his journey with the damsel and
the dwarf; at first he is scorned by her, like Sir Gareth
of Orkney in another story of the same sort, but very
soon he shows what he can do at the passage of the
Pont Perilous, and in the challenging of the gerfalcon,
and many other trials. Like other heroes of romance,
he falls under the spell of a sorceress who dazzles him
with &lsquo;fantasm and faerie&rsquo;, but he escapes after a long
delay, and defeats the magicians of Sinodoun and
rescues the lady with a kiss from her serpent shape
which the enchanters have put upon her. Compared
with Spenser&rsquo;s house of Busirane, the scene of Sir
Libeaus at Sinodoun is a small thing. But one does
not feel as in <i>Sir Tristrem</i> the discrepancy between the
miniature stage, the small bright figures, and the tragic
meaning of their story. Here the story is not tragic;
it is a story that the actors understand and can play
rightly. There are no characters and no motives
beyond the scope of a fairy tale&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">

</div>
<p>As if to show the range and the difference of style in
English romance, there is another story written like
<i>Sir Libeaus</i> in the reign of Edward III, taken from the
same Arthurian legend and beginning in the same way,
which has scarcely anything in common with it except
the general resemblance in the plot. This is <i>Sir
Gawain and the Green Knight</i>, one of the most original
works in medieval romance. It is written in alliterative
blank verse, divided into irregular periods which
have rhyming tailpieces at the end of them&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">As hit is stad and stoken</p>
<p class="t">In story stif and stronge</p>
<p class="t0">With leal letters loken</p>
<p class="t">In land so has been longe.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<p>While the story of <i>Sir Libeaus</i> is found in different
languages&mdash;French, Italian, German&mdash;there is no
other extant older version of <i>Gawain and the Green
Knight</i>. But the separate incidents are found elsewhere,
and the scene to begin with is the usual one:
Arthur at his court, Arthur keeping high festival and
waiting for &lsquo;some main marvel&rsquo;. The adventure
comes when it is wanted; the Green Knight on his
green horse rides into the king&rsquo;s hall&mdash;half-ogre, by
the look of him, to challenge the Round Table. What
he offers is a &lsquo;jeopardy&rsquo;, a hazard, a wager. &lsquo;Will any
gentleman cut off my head&rsquo;, says he, &lsquo;on condition
that I may have a fair blow at him, and no favour, in a
twelvemonth&rsquo;s time? Or if you would rather have it
so, let me have the first stroke, and I promise to offer
my neck in turn, when a year has gone&rsquo;. This is the
beheading game which is spoken of in other stories
(one of them an old Irish comic romance) but which
seems to have been new at that time to the knights of
King Arthur. It is rightly considered dangerous; and so
it proved when Sir Gawain had accepted the jeopardy.
For after Gawain had cut off the stranger&rsquo;s head, the
Green Knight picked it up by the hair, and held it up,
and it spoke and summoned Gawain to meet him
at the Green Chapel in a year&rsquo;s space, and bide the
return blow.</p>
<p>This is more surprising than anything in <i>Sir Bevis</i>
or <i>Sir Guy</i>. Not much is done by the writer to explain
it; at the same time nothing is left vague. The author
might almost have been a modern novelist with a
contempt for romance, trying, by way of experiment,
to work out a &lsquo;supernatural&rsquo; plot with the full strength
<span class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
of his reason; merely accepting the fabulous story, and
trying how it will go with accessories from real life,
and with modern manners and conversation. There is
none of the minstrel&rsquo;s cant in this work, none of the
cheap sensations, the hackneyed wonders such as are
ridiculed in <i>Sir Thopas</i>. Only, the incident on which
the whole story turns, the device of the beheading
game, is a piece of traditional romance. It is not
found in every language, but it is fairly well known.
It is not as common as the lady turned into a serpent,
or the man into a werewolf, but still it is not invented,
it is borrowed by the English poet, and borrowed for a
work which always, even in the beheading scenes, is
founded on reality.</p>
<p>It is probable that the author of <i>Sir Gawain</i> is also
the author of three other poems (not romances) which
are found along with it in the same manuscript&mdash;the
<i>Pearl</i>, <i>Cleanness</i>, and <i>Patience</i>. He is a writer with a
gift for teaching, of a peculiar sort. He is not an
original philosopher, and his reading appears to have
been the usual sort of thing among fairly educated men.
He does not try to get away from the regular authorities,
and he is not afraid of commonplaces. But he has
great force of will, and a strong sense of the difficulties
of life; also high spirits and great keenness. His
memory is well supplied from all that he has gone
through. The three sporting episodes in <i>Sir Gawain</i>,
the deer-hunt (in Christmas week, killing the hinds),
the boar-hunt and the fox-hunt, are not only beyond
question as to their scientific truth; the details are
remembered without study because the author has
lived in them, and thus, minute as they are, they are
<span class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
not wearisome. They do not come from a careful
notebook; they are not like the descriptions of rooms
and furniture in painstaking novels. The landscapes
and the weather of <i>Sir Gawain</i> are put in with the
same freedom. The author has a talent especially
for winter scenes. &lsquo;Grim Nature&rsquo;s visage hoar&rsquo; had
plainly impressed his mind, and not in a repulsive way.
The winter &lsquo;mist hackles&rsquo; (copes of mist) on the hills,
the icicles on the stones, the swollen streams, all come
into his work&mdash;a relief from the too ready illustrations
of spring and summer which are scattered about in
medieval stories.</p>
<p>The meaning of the story is in the character of
Gawain. Like some other romances, this is a
chivalrous <i>Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress</i>. Gawain, so much
vilified by authors who should have known better, is
for this poet, as he is for Chaucer, the perfection of
courtesy. He is also the servant of Our Lady, and
bears her picture on his shield, along with the pentangle
which is the emblem of her Five Joys, as well as the
Five Wounds of Christ. The poem is the ordeal of
Gawain; Gawain is tried in courage and loyalty by
his compact with the Green Knight; he is tried in
loyalty and temperance when he is wooed by the
wanton conversation of the lady in the castle. The
author&rsquo;s choice of a plot is justified, because what he
wants is an ordeal of courage, and that is afforded by
the Green Knight&rsquo;s &lsquo;jeopardy&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The alliterative poetry is almost always stronger
than the tales in rhyme, written with more zest, not
so much in danger of droning and sleepiness as the
school of Sir Thopas undoubtedly is. But there is
<span class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
a great difference among the alliterative romances.
<i>William of Palerne</i>, for example, is vigorous, but to
little purpose, because the author has not understood
the character of the French poem which he has
translated, and has misapplied his vigorous style to
the handling of a rather sophisticated story which
wanted the smooth, even, unemphatic, French style
to express it properly. <i>The Wars of Alexander</i> is the
least distinguished of the group; there was another
alliterative story of Alexander, of which only fragments
remain. The <i>Chevelere Assigne</i>, the &lsquo;Knight of the
Swan,&rsquo; is historically interesting, as giving the romantic
origin of Godfrey the Crusader, who is the last of the
Nine Worthies. Though purely romantic in its
contents, the <i>Chevalier au Cygne</i> belongs to one of the
French narrative groups usually called epic&mdash;the epic
of <i>Antioch</i>, which is concerned with the first Crusade.
The <i>Gest historial of the Destruction of Troy</i> is of great
interest; it is the liveliest of all the extant &lsquo;Troy Books&rsquo;,
and it has all the good qualities of the fourteenth-century
alliterative school, without the exaggeration
and violence which was the common fault of this style,
as the contrary fault of tameness was the danger of
the rhyming romances. But the alliterative poem
which ranks along with <i>Sir Gawayne</i> as an original
work with a distinct and fresh comprehension of its
subject is the <i>Morte Arthure</i>. This has some claim
to be called an epic poem, an epic of the modern kind,
composed with a definite theory. The author takes
the heroic view of Arthur given by Geoffrey of
Monmouth, and turns his warfare into a reflection of
the glory of King Edward III; not casually, but
<span class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
following definite lines, with almost as much tenacity
as the author of <i>Sir Gawayne</i>, and, of course, with a
greater theme. The tragedy of Arthur in Malory to
some extent repeats the work of this poet&mdash;whose
name was Huchoun of the Awle Ryale; it may have
been Sir Hugh of Eglinton.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">CHAPTER V</span>
<br />SONGS AND BALLADS</h2>
<p>King Canute&rsquo;s boat-song has some claim to be the
earliest English song in rhyme&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Merie sungen the muneches binnen Ely</p>
<p class="t0">Tha Knut king rew therby:</p>
<p class="t0">Roweth, knihtes, ner the land</p>
<p class="t0">And here we thes muneches sang.</p>
</div>
<p>If this claim be disallowed, then the first is St. Godric,
the hermit of Finchale in the reign of Henry II&mdash;his
hymn to Our Lady and the hymn to St. Nicholas.
These are preserved along with the music (like the
Cuckoo song which comes later); the manuscript of
the poems of Godric is copied in the frontispiece to
Saintsbury&rsquo;s <i>History of English Prosody</i>; it proves
many interesting things. It is obvious that musical
notation is well established; and it seems to follow
that with a good musical tradition there may be
encouragement for lyric poetry apart from any such
&lsquo;courtly&rsquo; circumstances as have been described in
another chapter. There is no doubt about this.
While it is certain on the one hand that the lyrical art
of the Middle Ages was carried furthest in courtly
society by the French, Proven&ccedil;al, German and Italian
poets, it is equally certain that the art of music
flourished also in out-of-the-way places. And as in
those days musical and poetical measures, tunes and
words, generally went together, the development of
<span class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
music would mean the development of poetical forms,
of lyric stanzas. Music flourished in England most
of all in Godric&rsquo;s country, the old Northumbria.
Giraldus Cambrensis, who has been quoted already
for his story of the wake and the English love-song,
gives in another place a remarkable description of the
part-singing which in his time was cultivated where it
is most in favour at the present day&mdash;in Wales, and
in England north of the Humber. Where people met
to sing in parts, where music, therefore, was accurate
and well studied, there must have been careful patterns
of stanza. Not much remains from a date so early
as this, nor even for a century after the time of Godric
and Giraldus. But towards the end of the reign of
Edward I lyric poems are found more frequently, often
careful in form. And in judging of their art it is well
to remember that it is not necessary to refer them to the
courtly schools for their origin. Country people might
be good judges of lyric; they might be as exacting
in their musical and poetical criticisms as any persons
of quality could be. Hence while it is certain that
England before the time of Chaucer was generally
rustic and provincial in its literary taste, it does not
follow that the rustic taste was uninstructed or that
the art was poor. The beauty of the English songs
between 1300 and 1500 is not that of the nobler lyric
as it was (for example) practised and described by
Dante. But the beauty is undeniable, and it is the
beauty of an art which has laws of its own; it is poetry,
not the primitive elements of poetry. In art, it is not
very far from that of the earlier Proven&ccedil;al poets. For
everywhere, it should be remembered, the noble lyric
<span class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
poetry was ready to draw from the popular sources, to
adapt and imitate the rustic themes; as on the other
hand the common people were often willing to take
up the courtly forms.</p>
<p>The earliest rhyming songs are more interesting
from their associations than their own merits; though
Canute and St. Godric are certainly able to put a good
deal of meaning into few words. Godric&rsquo;s address to
St. Nicholas is particularly memorable for its bearing
on his own history. Godric had been a sea captain
in his youth (like another famous author of hymns, the
Rev. John Newton) and St. Nicholas is the patron
saint of sailors. Godric, whose operations were in
the Levant, had often prayed to St. Nicholas of Bari,
and he brings the name of the saint&rsquo;s own city into his
hymn, by means of a sacred pun. &lsquo;Saint Nicholas&rsquo;,
he says, &lsquo;build us a far sheen house&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">At thi burch at thi bare</p>
<p class="t0">Sainte Nicholaes bring us wel thare.</p>
</div>
<p>&lsquo;Bare&rsquo; here means shrine, literally, but Godric is
thinking also of the name of the &lsquo;burgh&rsquo;, the city of
Bari to which the relics of the saint had been lately
brought.</p>
<p>Religious lyric poetry is not separate from other
kinds, and it frequently imitates the forms and language
of worldly songs. The <i>Luve Ron</i> of the Friar Minor
Thomas de Hales is one of the earliest poems of a type
something between the song and the moral poem&mdash;a
lyric rather far away from the music of a song, more
like the lyrics of modern poets, meant to be read rather
than sung, yet keeping the lyrical stave. One passage
<span class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
in it is on the favourite theme of the &lsquo;snows of yester
year&rsquo;&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Where is Paris and Heleyne</p>
<p class="t0">That were so bright and fair of blee!</p>
</div>
<p>This is earlier in date than the famous collection in
the Harleian MS., which is everything best worth
remembering in the old lyrical poetry&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Betwene Mersche and Averil</p>
<p class="t0">When spray beginneth to springe.</p>
</div>
<p>The lyrical contents of this book (there are other things
besides the songs&mdash;a copy of <i>King Horn</i>, e.g.)&mdash;the
songs of this Harleian MS.&mdash;are classified as religious,
amatory and satirical; but a better division is simply
into songs of love and songs of scorn. The division
is as old and as constant as anything in the world, and
the distinction between &lsquo;courtly&rsquo; and &lsquo;popular&rsquo; does
not affect it. In the older court poetry of Iceland, as
in the later of Provence and Germany, the lyric of
scorn and the lyric of praise were equally recognized.
The name &lsquo;Wormtongue&rsquo; given to an Icelandic poet
for his attacking poems would do very well for many
of the Proven&ccedil;als&mdash;for Sordello, particularly, whose
best-known poem is his lyrical satire on the Kings of
Christendom. It depends, of course, on fashion how
the lyrical attack shall be developed. In England it
could not be as subtle as in the countries of Bertran de
Born or Walter von der Vogelweide, where the poet
was a friend and enemy of some among the greatest
of the earth. The political songs in the Harleian
manuscript are anonymous, and express the heart of
the people. The earliest in date and the best known
<span class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
is the song of Lewes&mdash;a blast of laughter from the
partisans of Simon de Montfort following up the
pursuit of their defeated adversaries&mdash;thoroughly happy
and contemptuous, and not cruel. It is addressed to
&lsquo;Richard of Almain&rsquo;, Richard the king&rsquo;s brother, who
was looked on as the bad counsellor of his nephew
Edward&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Sir Simon de Montfort hath swore by his chin,</p>
<p class="t0">Hadde he now here the Erl of Warin</p>
<p class="t0">Sholde he never more come to his inn</p>
<p class="t0">With shelde, ne with spere, ne with other gin</p>
<p class="t2">To helpe of Windesore!</p>
<p class="t0"><i>Richard! thah thou be ever trichard,</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>Trichen shalt thou never more!</i></p>
</div>
<p>This very spirited song is preserved together with
some others dealing with later events in the life of
Edward. One of them is a long poem of exultation
over the death of the King&rsquo;s Scottish rebels, Sir
William Wallace and Sir Simon Fraser; the author
takes great pleasure in the treatment of Wallace by
the King and the hangman&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">

<p>The same poet gibes at a Scottish rebel who was then
still living and calls him a &lsquo;king of summer&rsquo; and &lsquo;King
Hob&rsquo;&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Nou kyng Hobbe in the mures gongeth.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<p>This King Hob of the moors was Robert the Bruce,
wandering, as Barbour describes him, over the land.
There is another very vigorous and rather long piece
on a recent defeat of the French by the Flemings at
Courtrai&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">

</div>
<p>This style of political journalism in rhyme was
carried on later with much spirit, and one author is
well known by name and has had his poems often
edited&mdash;Lawrence Minot, a good workman who is
sometimes undervalued. Lawrence Minot has command
of various lyrical measures; he has the clear
sharp phrasing which belongs generally to his northern
dialect, and he can put contempt into his voice
with no recourse to bad language. After describing
the threats and boasting of the French, when Minot
remarks</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">And yet is England as it was,</p>
</div>
<p>the effect is just where it ought to be, between wind
and water; the enemy is done for. It is like Prior&rsquo;s
observation to Boileau, in the <i>Ode</i> on the taking of
Namur, and the surrender of the French garrison&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Each was a Hercules, you tell us,</p>
<p class="t0">Yet out they marched like common men.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</div>
<p>Besides the songs of attack, there are also comic
poems, simply amusing without malice&mdash;such is the
excellent Harleian piece on the <i>Man in the Moon</i>, which
is the meditation of a solitary reveller, apparently
thinking out the problem of the Man and his thorn-bush

<p>A Franciscan brother in Ireland, Friar Michael of
Kildare, composed some good nonsensical poems&mdash;one
of them a rigmarole in which part of the joke is the
way he pretends to rhyme and then sticks in a word
that does not rhyme, asking all through for admiration
of his skill in verse. As a poetical joke it is curious,
and shows that Brother Michael was a critic and knew
the terms of his art. There are many literary games
in the Middle Ages, nonsense rhymes of different
sorts; they are connected with the serious art of
poetry which had its own &lsquo;toys and trifles&rsquo;&mdash;such feats
of skill in verse and rhyming as Chaucer shows in his
<i>Complaint of Anelida</i>. Tricks of verse were apt to
multiply as the poetic imagination failed&mdash;a substitute
for poetry; but many of the strongest poets have used
<span class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
them occasionally. Among all the artistic games one
of the most curious is where a Welsh poet (in Oxford
in the fifteenth century) gives a display of Welsh
poetical form with English words&mdash;to confute the
ignorant Saxon who had said there was no art of
poetry in Wales.</p>
<p>The stanza forms in the Harleian book are various,
and interesting to compare with modern stanzas.
There is an example of the verse which has travelled
from William of Poitiers, about the year 1100, to
Burns and his imitators. Modern poetry begins with
William of Poitiers using the verse of Burns in a
poem on <i>Nothing</i>&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The song I make is of no thing,</p>
<p class="t0">Of no one, nor myself, I sing,</p>
<p class="t0">Of joyous youth, nor love-longing,</p>
<p class="t3">Nor place, nor time;</p>
<p class="t0">I rode on horseback, slumbering:</p>
<p class="t3">There sprang this rhyme!</p>
</div>
<p>Two hundred years after, it is found in England&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Her eye hath wounded me, y-wisse,</p>
<p class="t0">Her bende browen that bringeth blisse;</p>
<p class="t0">Her comely mouth that might&egrave; kisse</p>
<p class="t3">In mirth he were;</p>
<p class="t0">I wold&egrave; chaung&egrave; mine for his</p>
<p class="t3">That is her fere!</p>
</div>
<p>The romance stanza is used also in its original
lyrical way, with a refrain added&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">For her love I cark and care</p>
<p class="t0">For her love I droop and dare</p>
<p class="t0">For her love my bliss is bare</p>
<p class="t3">And all I wax&egrave; wan;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<p class="t0">For her love in sleep I slake,</p>
<p class="t0">For her love all night I wake</p>
<p class="t0">For her love mourning I make</p>
<p class="t3">More than any man.</p>
<p class="t2"><i>Blow, northern wind!</i></p>
<p class="t2"><i>Send thou me my sweeting!</i></p>
<p class="t2"><i>Blow, northern wind!</i></p>
<p class="t2"><i>Blow! blow! blow!</i></p>
</div>
<p>Technically, it is to be noted that some of those
poems have the combination of a six-line with a four-line
passage which is frequent in French lyrics of all
ages, which is also found in the verse of <i>The Cherrie and
the Slae</i> (another of Burns&rsquo;s favourite measures), and
also in some of Gray&rsquo;s simpler odes. It is found in
one of the religious poems, with the six lines first,
and the four lines after, as in Burns. The common
French pattern arranges them the other way round,
and so does Gray, but the constituent parts are the
same.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Now shrinketh rose and lily flower</p>
<p class="t0">That whilom bare that sweete savour,</p>
<p class="t">In summer, that sweete tide;</p>
<p class="t0">Ne is no queene so stark ne stour,</p>
<p class="t0">Ne no lady so bright in bower</p>
<p class="t">That death ne shall by glide;</p>
<p class="t0">Whoso will flesh-lust forgon,</p>
<p class="t">And heaven bliss abide,</p>
<p class="t0">On Jesu be his thought anon,</p>
<p class="t">That thirled was his side.</p>
</div>
<p>This poem is a good text to prove the long ancestry
of modern verse, and the community of the nations,
often very remote from definite intercourse between
them. And there is one phrase in this stanza which
goes back to the older world: &lsquo;bright in bower&rsquo; is from
<span class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
the ancient heroic verse; it may be found in Icelandic,
in the Elder Edda.</p>
<p>The fifteenth century, which is so dismal in the
works of the more ambitious poets (Lydgate, and
Occleve, e.g.), is rich in popular carols which by this
time have drawn close to the modern meaning of the
name. They are Christmas carols, and the name loses
its old general application to any song that went with
dancing in a round. In the carols, the art is generally
much more simple than in the lyrics which have just
been quoted; they belong more truly to the common
people, and their authors are less careful. Yet the
difference is one of degree. The only difference which
is really certain is between one poem and another.</p>
<p>Speaking generally about the carols one may say
truly they are unlike the work of the Chaucerian
school; the lyrics of the Harleian book in the reign of
Edward I are nearer the Chaucerian manner. It is
hardly worth while to say more, for the present.</p>
<p>And it is not easy to choose among the carols.
Some of them are well known to-day&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">When Christ was born of Mary free</p>
<p class="t0">In Bethlehem that fair city</p>
<p class="t0">Angels sang loud with mirth and glee</p>
<p class="t3"><i>In excelsis gloria</i>.</p>
</div>
<p>Ballads in the ordinary sense of the term&mdash;ballads
with a story in them, like <i>Sir Patrick Spens</i> or <i>The Milldams
of Binnorie</i>&mdash;are not found in any quantity till
late in the Middle Ages, and hardly at all before the
fifteenth century. But there are some early things
of the kind. A rhyme of <i>Judas</i> (thirteenth century) is
<span class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
reckoned among the ballads by the scholar (the late
Professor Child) who gave most time to the subject,
and whose great collection of the English and Scottish
Popular Ballads has brought together everything
ascertainable about them.</p>
<p>By some the ballads are held to be degenerate
romances; and they appear at a time when the best
of romance was over, and when even the worst was
dying out. Also, it is quite certain that some ballads
are derived from romances. There is a ballad of the
young <i>Hynd Horn</i> which comes from the old narrative
poem of <i>King Horn</i> or of <i>Horn Childe</i>. There is a
ballad version of <i>Sir Orfeo</i>, the &lsquo;Breton lay&rsquo; which has
been described in another chapter. But there are
great difficulties in the way of this theory. In the
first place, there are many ballads which have no
romance extant to correspond to them. That may not
prove much, for many old romances have been lost.
But if one is to make allowance for chances of this
sort, then many old ballads may have been lost also,
and many extant ballads may go back to the thirteenth
century or even earlier for their original forms. Again,
there are ballads which it is scarcely possible to think
of as existing in the shape of a narrative romance.
The form of the ballad is lyrical; all ballads are lyrical
ballads, and some of them at any rate would lose their
meaning utterly if they were paraphrased into a story.
What would the story of <i>Sir Patrick Spens</i> be worth
if it were told in any other way&mdash;with a description of
the scenery about Dunfermline, the domestic establishment
of the King of Norway, and the manners at his
Court? Further, the theory that the ballads are
<span class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
degenerate romances is unfair to those ballads which
are known to be descended from romances. The
ballad of <i>Hynd Horn</i> may be derived from an older
narrative poem, but it is not a <i>corruption</i> of any old
narrative; it is a different thing, in a lyrical form which
has a value of its own. &lsquo;Corruption&rsquo;, &lsquo;degeneracy&rsquo;,
does not explain the form of the ballads, any more
than the Miracle Plays are explained by calling them
corruptions of the Gospel.</p>
<p>The proper form of the ballads is the same as
the <i>carole</i>, with narrative substance added. Anything
will do for a ring dance, either at a wake in a churchyard,
or in a garden like that of the <i>Roman de la Rose</i>,
or at Christmas games like those described in <i>Sir
Gawayne and the Green Knight</i>. At first, a love-song
was the favourite sort, with a refrain of <i>douce amie</i>,
and so on. But the method was always the same;
there was a leader who sang the successive verses,
the fresh lines of the song, while the other dancers
came in with the refrain, most often in two parts, one
after the first verse, the second after the second&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">When that I was and a little tiny boy</p>
<p class="t"><i>With a heigh-ho, the wind and the rain</i>,</p>
<p class="t0">A foolish thing was but a toy</p>
<p class="t"><i>And the rain it raineth every day</i>.</p>
</div>
<p>The narrative ballad was most in favour where
people were fondest of dancing. The love-song or
the nonsense verses could not be kept up so long;
something more was wanted, and this was given by
the story; also as the story was always dramatic, more
or less, with different people speaking, the entertainment
<span class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
was all the better. If this is not the whole
explanation, it still accounts for something in the
history, and it is certainly true of some places where
the ballad has flourished longest. The <i>carole</i> has
lasted to the present day in the Faroe Islands, together
with some very ancient types of tune; and there the
ballads are much longer than in other countries,
because the dancers are unwearied and wish to keep
it up as long as may be. So the ballads are spun out,
enormously.</p>
<p>The history of ballad poetry in Western Europe, if
one dates it from the beginning of the French <i>carole</i>
fashion&mdash;about 1100&mdash;is parallel to the history of pure
lyric, and to the history of romance. It is distinct
from both, and related to both. There are many
mysterious things in it. The strangest thing of all is
that it often seems to repeat in comparatively modern
times&mdash;in the second half of the Middle Ages&mdash;what
has been generally held to be the process by which
epic poetry begins. There is reason for thinking that
epic poetry began in concerted lyric, something like
the ballad chorus. The oldest Anglo-Saxon heroic
poem, <i>Widsith</i>, is near to lyric; <i>Deor&rsquo;s Lament</i> is
lyric, with a refrain. The old Teutonic narrative
poetry (as in <i>Beowulf</i>) may have grown out of a very
old sort of ballad custom, where the narrative elements
increased and gradually killed the lyric, so that recitation
of a story by the minstrel took the place of the
dancing chorus. However that may be, it is certain
that the ballads of Christendom in the Middle Ages
are related in a strange way to the older epic poetry,
not by derivation, but by sympathy. The ballad
<span class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
poets think in the same manner as the epic poets
and choose by preference the same kind of plot.
The plots of epics are generally the plots of tragedies.
This is one of the great differences between the Anglo-Saxon
heroic poetry and the later romances. It is a
difference also between the romances and the ballads.
Few of the romances are tragical. The story of
Tristram and the story of King Arthur are tragical;
but the romantic poets are beaten by the story of
Tristram, and they generally keep away from the
tragedy of Arthur. The ballads often have happy
endings, but not nearly so often as the romances; in
the best of the ballads there is a sorrowful ending;
in many there is a tragical mistake; in many (and in
how few of the romances!) there is a repetition of the
old heroic scene, the last resistance against the enemy
as in Roncevaux or in the <i>Nibelunge N&ocirc;t</i>. <i>Chevy Chase</i>
is the ballad counterpart of <i>Maldon</i>; <i>Parcy Reed</i> or
<i>Johnny of Braidislee</i> answers in the ballad form to the
fight at <i>Finnesburgh</i>, a story of a treacherous onset and
a good defence. Parcy Reed, beset and betrayed, is
more like a northern hero than a knight of romance.</p>
<p>The mystery is that the same kind of choice should
be found in all the countries where ballads were sung.
The English and Scottish ballads, like the English
romances, are related to similar things in other lands.
To understand the history of the ballads it is necessary,
as with the romances, to compare different versions of
the same matter&mdash;French or German, Italian, Danish.</p>
<p>Many curious things have been brought out by
study of this sort&mdash;resemblances of ballad plots all
over Christendom. But there is a sort of resemblance
<span class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
which no amount of &lsquo;analogues&rsquo; in different languages
can explain, and that is the likeness in temper among
the ballad poets of different languages, which not only
makes them take up the same stories, but makes them
deal with fresh realities in the same way. How is it
that an English ballad poet sees the death of Parcy
Reed in a certain manner, while a Danish poet far off
will see the same poetical meaning in a Danish adventure,
and will turn it into the common ballad form?
In both cases it is the death of a hero that the poet
renders in verse; deaths of heroes are a subject for
poetry, it may be said, all over the world. But how
is it that this particular form should be used in different
countries for the same kind of subject, not conventionally,
but with imaginative life, each poet independently
seizing this as the proper subject and treating it with
all the force of his mind?</p>
<p>The medieval ballad is a form used by poets with
their eyes open upon life, and with a form of thought
in their minds by which they comprehend a tragic
situation. The medieval romance is a form used
originally by poets with a certain vein of sentiment
who found that narrative plots helped them to develop
their emotional rhetoric; then it passed through
various stages in different countries, sinking into chapbooks
or rising to the <i>Orlando</i> or the <i>Faerie Queene</i>&mdash;but
never coming back to the old tragic form of
imagination, out of which the older epics had been
derived, and which is constantly found in the ballads.</p>
<p>Probably the old ballad chorus in its proper dancing
form was going out of use in England about 1400.
Barbour, a contemporary of Chaucer, speaks of girls
<span class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
singing ballads &lsquo;at their play&rsquo;; Thomas Deloney in
the time of Elizabeth describes the singing of a ballad
refrain; and the game lives happily still, in songs of
<i>London Bridge</i> and others. But it became more and
more common for ballads to be sung or recited to an
audience sitting still; ballads were given out by
minstrels, like the minstrel of <i>Chevy Chase</i>. Sometimes
ballads are found swelling into something like a
narrative poem; such is the famous ballad of <i>Adam
Bell, Clim o&rsquo; the Clough, and William of Cloudeslee</i>,
which has a plot of the right sort, the defence of a
house against enemies. <i>The Little Geste of Robin
Hood</i> seems to be an attempt to make an epic poem by
joining together a number of ballads. The ballad of
<i>Robin Hood&rsquo;s Death</i> is worth reading as a contrast to
this rather mechanical work. <i>Robin Hood&rsquo;s Death</i> is a
ballad tragedy; again, the death of a hero beset by
traitors. Red Roger stabbed Robin with a grounden
glave (&lsquo;grounden&rsquo; comes from the oldest poetic
vocabulary). Robin made &lsquo;a wound full wide&rsquo; between
Roger&rsquo;s head and his shoulders. Then he asks Little
John for the sacrament, the housel of earth (he calls
it &lsquo;moud&rsquo;, i.e. &lsquo;mould&rsquo;) which could be given and taken
by any Christian man, in extremity, without a priest&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&lsquo;Now give me moud,&rsquo; Robin said to Little John,</p>
<p class="t0">&lsquo;Now give me moud with thy hand;</p>
<p class="t0">I trust to God in heaven so high</p>
<p class="t0">My housel will me bestand.&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>And he refuses to let Little John burn the house of
the treacherous Prioress where he had come by his
death. This is heroic poetry in its simplest form,
and quite true to its proper nature.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<p>The beauty of the ballads is uncertain and often
corrupted by forgetfulness and the ordinary accidents
of popular tradition. It is not always true that the
right subject has the best form. But the grace of
the ballads is unmistakable; it is unlike anything in the
contemporary romances, because it is lyrical poetry.
It is often vague and intangible. It is never the same
as narrative romance.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">He&rsquo;s tane three locks o&rsquo; her yellow hair,</p>
<p class="t"><i>Binnorie, O Binnorie!</i></p>
<p class="t0">And wi&rsquo; them strung his harp so fair</p>
<p class="t"><i>By the bonny mill-dams o&rsquo; Binnorie</i>.</p>
</div>
<p>It is the singing voice that makes the difference; and
it is a difference of thought as well as of style.</p>

<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">CHAPTER VI</span>
<br />COMIC POETRY</h2>
<p>France sets the model for comic as well as romantic
poetry, in the Middle Ages. In romance the English
were not able for a long time&mdash;hardly before Chaucer
and Gower&mdash;to imitate the French style properly;
the French sentiment was beyond them, not appreciated;
they took the stories, the action and adventures,
and let the sentiment alone, or abridged it. The
reasons for this are obvious. But there seems to be
no reason, except accident, for the way in which the
English writers in those times neglected the French
comic literature of the twelfth century. Very little
of it is represented in the English of the following
centuries; yet what there is in English corresponding
to the French <i>fabliaux</i> and to Reynard the Fox is
thoroughly well done. The English wit was quite
equal to the French in matters such as these; there
were no difficulties of style or caste in the way, such
as prevented the English minstrels from using much
of the French romantic, sentimental rhetoric. There
might have been a thirteenth-century English <i>Reynard</i>,
as good as the High or Low German <i>Reynards</i>; that
is proved by the one short example (295 lines) in
which an episode of the great medieval comic epic is
told by an English versifier&mdash;the story of <i>The Vox and
the Wolf</i>. This is one of the best of all the practical
jokes of Reynard&mdash;the well-known story of the Fox
and the Wolf in the well. It is told again, in a different
<span class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
way, among the Fables of the Scottish poet Robert
Henryson; it is also one of the stories of Uncle Remus.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">A vox gan out of the wod&egrave; go,</p>
</div>
<p>and made his way to a hen-roost, where he got three
hens out of five, and argued with Chauntecler the cock,
explaining, though unsuccessfully, that a little blood-letting
might be good for him; thence, being troubled
with thirst, he went to the well. The well had two
buckets on a rope over a pulley; the Fox &lsquo;ne understood
nought of the gin&rsquo; and got into one of the buckets
and went down to the bottom of the well; where he
repented of his gluttony. The comic epic is as moral
as Piers Plowman; that is part of the game.</p>
<p>Then (&lsquo;out of the depe wode&rsquo;) appeared the Wolf,
Sigrim (Isengrim), also thirsty, and looking for a drink;
he heard the lamentations of his gossip Reneuard, and
sat down by the well and called to him. Then at last
the Fox&rsquo;s wit returned and he saw how he might
escape. There was nothing (he said) he would have
prayed for more than that his friend should join him
in the happy place: &lsquo;here is the bliss of Paradise&rsquo;.
&lsquo;What! art thou dead?&rsquo; says the Wolf: &lsquo;this is
news; it was only three days ago that thou and thy
wife and children all came to dine with me.&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes!
I am dead&rsquo;, says the Fox. &lsquo;I would not return to the
world again, for all the world&rsquo;s wealth. Why should
I walk in the world, in care and woe, in filth and sin?
But this place is full of all happiness; here is mutton,
both sheep and goat.&rsquo; When the Wolf heard of this
good meat his hunger overcame him and he asked to
be let in. &lsquo;Not till thou art shriven&rsquo;, says the Fox;
<span class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
and the Wolf bends his head, sighing hard and strong,
and makes his confession, and gets forgiveness, and is
happy.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Nou ich am in clene live</p>
<p class="t0">Ne recche ich of childe ne of wive.</p>
</div>
<p>&lsquo;But tell me what to do.&rsquo; &lsquo;Do!&rsquo; quoth the Fox, &lsquo;leap
into the bucket, and come down.&rsquo; And the Wolf
going down met the Fox half-way; Reynard, &lsquo;glad
and blithe&rsquo; that the Wolf was a true penitent and in
clean living, promised to have his soul-knell rung and
masses said for him.</p>
<p>The well, it should be said, belonged to a house of
friars; Aylmer the &lsquo;master curtler&rsquo; who looked after
the kitchen-garden came to the well in the morning;
and the Wolf was pulled out and beaten and hunted;
he found no bliss and no indulgence of blows.</p>
<p>The French story has some points that are not in
the English; in the original, the two buckets on the
pulley are explained to Isengrim as being God&rsquo;s
balance of good and evil, in which souls are weighed.
Also there is a more satisfactory account of the way
Reynard came to be entrapped. In the English story
the failure of his wit is rather disgraceful; in the
French he takes to the bucket because he thinks he
sees his wife Hermeline in the bottom of the well;
it is a clear starlight night, and as he peers over the
rim of the well he sees the figure looking up at him,
and when he calls there is a hollow echo which he
takes for a voice answering. But there is no such
difference of taste and imagination here between the
French and the English Reynard as there is between
the French and the English chivalrous romances.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<p>The <i>Roman de Renart</i> is generally, and justly, taken
as the ironical counterpart of medieval epic and
romance; an irreverent criticism of dignitaries, spiritual
and temporal, the great narrative comedy of the Ages
of Faith and of Chivalry. The comic short stories
usually called <i>fabliaux</i> are most of them much less
intelligent; rhyming versions of ribald jokes, very
elementary. But there are great differences among
them, and some of them are worth remembering. It
is a pity there is no English version of the <i>jongleur</i>,
the professional minstrel, who, in the absence of the
devils, is put in charge of the souls in Hell, but is
drawn by St. Peter to play them away at a game of
dice&mdash;the result being that he is turned out; since
then the Master Devil has given instructions: No
Minstrels allowed within.</p>
<p>There are few English <i>fabliaux</i>; there is perhaps
only one preserved as a separate piece by itself, the
story of <i>Dame Sirith</i>. This is far above the ordinary
level of such things; it is a shameful practical joke,
but there is more in it than this; the character of
Dame Sirith, in her machinations to help the distressed
lover of his neighbour&rsquo;s wife, is such as belongs to
comedy and to satire, not to the ordinary vulgar &lsquo;merry
tale&rsquo;.</p>
<p>It is hard to find any other separate tale of this class
in English; but the stories of the Seven Wise Masters,
the Seven Sages of Rome, are many of them impossible
to distinguish from the common type of the French
<i>fabliaux</i>, though they are often classed among the
romances. There are many historical problems connected
with the medieval short stories. Although they
<span class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
do not appear in writing to any large extent before
the French rhyming versions, they are known to have
been current long before the twelfth century and before
the French language was used in literature. There
are Latin versions of some of them composed in
Germany before the <i>fabliaux</i> had come into existence;
one of them in substance is the same as Hans Andersen&rsquo;s
story of Big Claus and Little Claus, which also is
found as one of the <i>fabliaux</i>. Evidently, there are a
number of comic stories which have been going about
for hundreds (or thousands) of years without any need
of a written version. At any time, in any country, it
may occur to some one to put one of those stories into
literary language. Two of the German-Latin comic
poems are in elaborate medieval verse, set to religious
tunes, in the form of the <i>Sequentia</i>&mdash;a fact which is
mentioned here only to show that there was nothing
popular in these German experiments. They were
not likely to found a school of comic story-telling;
they were too difficult and exceptional; literary
curiosities. The French <i>fabliaux</i>, in the ordinary short
couplets and without any literary ornament, were
absolutely popular; it needed no learning and not
much wit to understand them. So that, as they spread
and were circulated, they came often to be hardly
distinguishable from the traditional stories which had
been going about all the time in spoken, not written,
forms. It was one of the great popular successes of
medieval French literature; and it was due partly to
the French stories themselves, and partly to the
example which they set, that comic literature was
cultivated in the later Middle Ages. The French
<span class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
stories were translated and adapted by Boccaccio
and many others; and when the example had
once been given, writers in different languages
could find stories of their own without going to the
<i>fabliaux</i>.</p>
<p>Does it matter much to any one where these stories
came from, and how they passed from oral tradition
into medieval (or modern) literary forms? The
question is more reasonable than such questions usually
are, because most of these stories are trivial, they are
not all witty, and many of them are villainous. But
the historical facts about them serve to bring out, at
any rate, the extraordinary talent of the French for
making literary profit out of every kind of material.
Any one might have thought of writing out these
stories which every one knew; but, with the exception
of the few Latin experiments, this was done by nobody
till the French took it up.</p>
<p>Further, those &lsquo;merry tales&rsquo; come into the whole
subject of the relations between folk-lore and literature,
which is particularly important (for those who like
that sort of inquiry) in the study of the Middle Ages.
All the fiction of the Middle Ages, comic or romantic,
is full of things which appear in popular tales like
those collected by Grimm in Germany or by Campbell
of Islay in the West Highlands. So much of medieval
poetry is traditional or popular&mdash;the ballads especially&mdash;that
folk-lore has to be studied more carefully than
is needful when one is dealing with later times. With
regard to short comic tales of the type of the <i>fabliaux</i>,
part of the problem is easy enough, if one accepts the
opinion that stories like <i>Big Claus and Little Claus</i>,
<span class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
which are found all over the world, and which can be
proved to have been current orally for centuries,
are things existing, and travelling, independently of
written books, which may at any time be recorded in a
written form. The written form may be literary,
as when the story is written in Latin verse by an early
German scholar, or in French medieval verse by a
minstrel or a minstrel&rsquo;s hack, or in fine Danish prose
by Hans Andersen. Or it may be written down by a
scientific collector of folk-lore keeping closely to the
actual phrasing of the unsophisticated story-teller; as
when the plot is found among the Ananzi stories of
the negroes in the West Indies. The life of popular
stories is mysterious; but it is well known in fact,
and there is no difficulty in understanding how the
popular story which is perennial in every climate
may any day be used for the literary fashion of that
day.</p>
<p>It is rather strange that while there is so much
folk-lore in medieval literature there should be so few
medieval stories which take up exactly the plots of
any of the popular traditional tales. And it is a
curious coincidence that two of the plots from folk-lore
which are used in medieval literature, distinctly,
by themselves, keeping to the folk-lore outlines, should
also appear in literary forms equally distinct and no less
true to their traditional shape among the Tales of
Andersen. One is that which has just been mentioned,
<i>Big Claus and Little Claus</i>, which comes into English
rather late in the Middle Ages as the <i>Friars of Berwick</i>.
The other is the <i>Travelling Companion</i>, which in English
rhyming romance is called <i>Sir Amadace</i>. There is
<span class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
something fortunate about those two stories which has
gained for them more attention than the rest. They
both come into the Elizabethan theatre, where again
it is curiously rare to find a folk-lore plot. One is
Davenport&rsquo;s <i>New Trick to Cheat the Devil</i>; the other,
the <i>Travelling Companion</i>, is Peele&rsquo;s <i>Old Wives&rsquo;
Tale</i>.</p>
<p>With most of the short stories it is useless to seek
for any definite source. To ask for the first author of
<i>Big Claus and Little Claus</i> is no more reasonable than
to ask who was the inventor of High Dutch and Low
Dutch. But there is a large section of medieval
story-telling which is in a different condition, and
about which it is not wholly futile to ask questions of
pedigree. <i>The Seven Sages of Rome</i> is the best
example of this class; it has been remarked already
that many things in the book are like the <i>fabliaux</i>;
but unlike most of the <i>fabliaux</i> they have a literary
origin which can be traced. The Book of the Seven
Wise Masters of Rome (which exists in many different
forms, with a variety of contents) is an Oriental
collection of stories in a framework; that is to say,
there is a plot which leads to the telling of stories, as
in the <i>Arabian Nights</i>, the <i>Decameron</i>, the <i>Canterbury
Tales</i>. The <i>Arabian Nights</i> were not known in the
West till the beginning of the eighteenth century, but
the Oriental plan of a group of stories was brought to
Europe at least as early as the twelfth century. The
plot of the <i>Seven Sages</i> is that the son of the Emperor of
Rome is falsely accused by his stepmother, and defended
by the Seven Masters, the Empress and the Masters
telling stories against one another. As the object of
<span class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
the Masters is to prove that women are not to be
trusted, it may be understood that their stories generally
agree in their moral with the common disrespectful
&lsquo;merry tales&rsquo;. Among the lady&rsquo;s stories are some of a
different complexion; one of these is best known in
England through W. R. Spencer&rsquo;s ballad of the death
of Gelert, the faithful hound who saved the child of
his lord, and was hastily and unjustly killed in error.
Another is the story of the Master Thief, which is
found in the second book of Herodotus&mdash;the treasure
of Rhampsinitus, king of Egypt.</p>
<p>One of those Oriental fables found among the old
French short stories comes into English long afterwards
in the form of Parnell&rsquo;s <i>Hermit</i>.</p>
<p>Although the <i>fabliaux</i> are not very largely represented
in medieval English rhyme, there is a considerable
amount of miscellaneous comic verse. One of
the great differences between Middle English and
Anglo-Saxon writings (judging from what is extant)
is that in Middle English there is far more jesting
and nonsense. The best of the comic pieces is one
that might be reckoned along with the <i>fabliaux</i> except
that there is no story in it; the description of the <i>Land
of Cockayne</i>, sometimes called the land of Readymade,
where the geese fly about roasted&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Yet I do you mo to wit</p>
<p class="t0">The geese y-roasted on the spit</p>
<p class="t0">Fleeth to that abbey, Got it wot</p>
<p class="t0">And gredeth: Geese all hot, all hot!</p>
</div>
<p>The land of Cockayne is a burlesque Paradise &lsquo;far
in the sea by West of Spain&rsquo;.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">There beth rivers great and fine</p>
<p class="t0">Of oil, milk, honey and wine;</p>
<p class="t0">Water serveth there to no thing,</p>
<p class="t0">But to sight and to washing.</p>
</div>
<p>This piece, and <i>Reynard and Isengrim (The Fox and
the Wolf)</i>, and others, show that fairly early, and before
the French language had given way to English as the
proper speech for good society, there was some talent
in English authors for light verse, narrative or descriptive,
for humorous stories, and for satire. The
English short couplets of those days&mdash;of the time of
Henry III and Edward I&mdash;are at no disadvantage as
compared with the French. Anything can be expressed
in that familiar verse which is possible in French&mdash;anything,
except the finer shades of sentiment, for
which as yet the English have no mind, and which
must wait for the authors of the <i>Confessio Amantis</i> and
the <i>Book of the Duchess Blanche</i>.</p>
<p>But there is one early poem&mdash;a hundred, it may be
a hundred and fifty, years before Chaucer&mdash;in which
not the sentiment but something much more characteristic
of Chaucer is anticipated in a really wonderful
way. <i>The Owl and the Nightingale</i> is an original poem,
written in the language of Dorset at a time when
nothing English was considered &lsquo;courteous&rsquo;. Yet
it is hard to see what is wanting to the poem to distinguish
it from the literature of polite society in the
Augustan ages. What is there provincial in it, except
the language? And why should the language be
called, except in a technical and literal sense, rustic,
when it is used with a perfect command of idiom,
with tact and discretion, with the good humour that
<span class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
comprehends many different things and motives at
once, and the irony which may be a check on effusive
romance, but never a hindrance to grace and beauty?
Urbanity is the right word, the name one cannot help
using, for the temper of this rustic and provincial
poem. It is urbane, like Horace or Addison, without
any town society to support the author in his criticism
of life. The author is like one of the personages in
his satire, the Wren, who was bred in the greenwood,
but brought up among mankind&mdash;in the humanities:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">For theih heo were ybred a wolde</p>
<p class="t0">Heo was ytowen among mankenne,</p>
<p class="t0">And hire wisdom broughte thenne.</p>
</div>
<p><i>The Owl and the Nightingale</i> is the most miraculous
piece of writing, or, if that is too strong a term, the
most contrary to all preconceived opinion, among
the medieval English books. In the condition of the
English language in the reign of Henry III, with so
much against it, there was still no reason why there
should not be plenty of English romances and a
variety of English songs, though they might not be
the same sort of romances and songs as were composed
in countries like France or Germany, and though they
might be wanting in the &lsquo;finer shades&rsquo;. But all the
chances, as far as we can judge, were against the
production of humorous impartial essays in verse.
Such things are not too common at any time. They
were not common even in French polite literature in
the thirteenth century. In the century after, Froissart
in French, Gower and of course Chaucer in English
have the same talent for light familiar rhyming essays
<span class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
that is shown by Prior and Swift. The early English
poet had discovered for himself a form which generally
requires ages of training and study before it can
succeed.</p>
<p>His poem is entitled in one of the two MSS. <i>altercatio
inter Philomenam et Bubonem</i>: &lsquo;A debate between
the Nightingale and the Owl.&rsquo; Debates, contentions,
had been a favourite literary device for a long time
in many languages. It was known in Anglo-Saxon
poetry. It was common in France. There were
contentions of Summer and Winter, of the Soul and
the Body, the Church and the Synagogue, of Fast and
Feasting; there were also (especially in the Proven&ccedil;al
school) debates between actual men, one poet challenging
another. The originality of <i>The Owl and the
Nightingale</i> argument is that it is not, like so many
of those poetical disputations, simply an arrangement
of all the obvious commonplaces for and against one
side and the other. It is a true comedy; not only is
the writer impartial, but he keeps the debate alive;
he shows how the contending speakers feel the strokes,
and hide their pain, and do their best to face it out with
the adversary. Also, the debate is not a mere got-up
thing. It is Art against Philosophy; the Poet meeting
the strong though not silent Thinker, who tells him
of the Immensities and Infinities. The author agrees
with Plato and Wordsworth that the nightingale is
&lsquo;a creature of a fiery heart&rsquo;, and that the song is one
of mirth and not lamentation. Yet it is not contrasted
absolutely with the voice of the contemplative person.
If it were, the debate would come to an end, or would
turn into mere railing accusations&mdash;of which there
<span class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
is no want, it may be said, along with the more serious
arguments. What makes the dispute worth following,
what lifts it far above the ordinary medieval conventions,
is that each party shares something of the
other&rsquo;s mind. The Owl wishes to be thought musical;
the Nightingale is anxious not to be taken for a mere
worldling.</p>

<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">CHAPTER VII</span>
<br />ALLEGORY</h2>
<p>Allegory is often taken to be the proper and characteristic
mode of thought in the Middle Ages, and
certainly there is no kind of invention which is
commoner. The allegorical interpretation of Scripture
was the regular, the universal method employed by
preachers and commentators. Anglo-Saxon religious
writings are full of it. At the Revival of Learning, five
hundred years after &AElig;lfric, the end of the Middle
Ages is marked by a definite attack upon the allegorical
method, an attack carried on by religious reformers
and classical scholars, who held that allegory perverted
and destroyed the genuine teaching of Scripture, and
the proper understanding of Virgil and Ovid.</p>
<p>The book in which this medieval taste is most
plainly exhibited is the <i>Gesta Romanorum</i>, a collection
of stories, in Latin prose, drawn from many different
sources, each story having the moral interpretation
attached to it, for the use of preachers.</p>
<p>One of the most popular subjects for moral interpretation
was natural history. There is a book called
<i>Physiologus</i>&mdash;&lsquo;the Natural Philosopher&rsquo;&mdash;which went
through all the languages in the same way as the story
of Alexander or the book of the Seven Wise Masters.
There are fragments of an Anglo-Saxon rendering, in
verse&mdash;the <i>Whale</i>, and the <i>Panther</i>, favourite examples.
The Whale is the Devil; the Whale lying in the sea
with his back above water is often mistaken by sailors
<span class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
for an island; they land on his back to rest, and the
Whale goes down with them to the depths. The
common name for these natural histories (versions or
adaptations of <i>Physiologus</i>) is &lsquo;Bestiary&rsquo;; there is an
English <i>Bestiary</i> of the beginning of the thirteenth
century, most of it in the irregular alliterative verse
which seems to have been common at that date; some
of it is in fairly regular rhyme.</p>
<p>Allegorical interpretation of Scripture, or of stories,
or of natural history is not the same thing as allegorical
invention. This is sometimes forgotten, but it is
clear enough that an allegory such as the <i>Pilgrim&rsquo;s
Progress</i> has a quite different effect on the mind, and
requires a different sort of imagination, from the
allegorical work which starts from a given text and
spins out some sort of moral from it. Any one with
a little ingenuity can make an allegorical interpretation
of any matter. It is a different thing to invent and
carry on an allegorical story. One obvious difference
is that in the first case&mdash;for example in the <i>Bestiary</i>&mdash;the
two meanings, literal and allegorical, are separate
from one another. Each chapter of the <i>Bestiary</i> is
in two parts; first comes the <i>nature</i> of the beast&mdash;<i>natura
leonis, etc.</i>&mdash;the natural history of the lion, the
ant, the whale, the panther and so forth; then comes
the <i>signification</i>. In the other kind of allegory, though
there is a double meaning, there are not two separate
meanings presented one after the other to the mind.
The signification is given along with, or through, the
scene and the figures. Christian in the <i>Pilgrim&rsquo;s
Progress</i> is not something different from the Christian
man whom he represents allegorically; Mr. Greatheart,
<span class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
without any interpretation at all, is recognized
at once as a courageous guide and champion. So when
the Middle Ages are blamed for their allegorical
tastes it may be well to distinguish between the
frequently mechanical allegory which forces a moral
out of any object, and the imaginative allegory which
puts fresh pictures before the mind. The one process
starts from a definite story or fact, and then destroys
the story to get at something inside; the other makes
a story and asks you to accept it and keep it along
with its allegorical meaning.</p>
<p>Thus allegorical invention, in poetry like Spenser&rsquo;s,
or in imaginative prose like Bunyan&rsquo;s, may be something
not very different from imaginative work with
no conscious allegory in it at all. All poetry has something
of a representative character in it, and often it
matters little for the result whether the composer has
any definite symbolical intention or not. <i>Beowulf</i> or
<i>Samson Agonistes</i> might be said to &lsquo;stand for&rsquo; heroism,
just as truly as the Red Cross Knight in Spenser, or
Mr. Valiant for Truth in the <i>Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress</i>. So in
studying medieval allegories either in poetry, painting
or sculpture, it seems advisable to consider in each
case how far the artist has strained his imagination
to serve an allegorical meaning, or whether he has
not succeeded in being imaginative with no proper
allegorical meaning at all.</p>
<p>By far the best known and most influential of
medieval allegories is the <i>Romance of the Rose</i>. Both
in France and in England it kept its place as a poetical
example and authority from the thirteenth century till
well on in the sixteenth. It is the work of two authors;
<span class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
the later, Jean Clopinel or Jean de Meung, taking up
the work of Guillaume de Lorris about 1270, forty
years after the death of the first inventor. The part
written by Jean Clopinel is a rambling allegorical
satire, notorious for its slander against women. The
earlier part, by Guillaume de Lorris, is what really
made the fame and spread the influence of the <i>Roman
de la Rose</i>, though the second part was not far below
it in importance.</p>
<p>Guillaume de Lorris is one of those authors, not
very remarkable for original genius, who put together
all the favourite ideas and sentiments of their time in
one book from which they come to be distributed
widely among readers and imitators. His book is an
allegory of all the spirit and doctrine of French
romantic poetry for the past hundred years; and as
the French poets had taken all they could from the
lyric poets of Provence, the <i>Roman de la Rose</i> may be
fairly regarded as an abstract of the Proven&ccedil;al lyrical
ideas almost as much as of French sentiment. It was
begun just at the time when the Proven&ccedil;al poetry
was ended in the ruin of the South and of the Southern
chivalry, after the Albigensian crusade.</p>
<p>No apology is needed for speaking of this poem in a
discourse on English literature. Even if Chaucer had
not translated it, the <i>Roman de la Rose</i> would still be a
necessary book for any one who wishes to understand
not only Chaucer but the poets of his time and all his
successors down to Spenser. The influence of the
<i>Roman de la Rose</i> is incalculable. It is acknowledged
by the poet whose style is least like Chaucer&rsquo;s, except
for its liveliness, among all the writers in the reign of
<span class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
Edward III&mdash;by the author of the alliterative poem on
<i>Purity</i>, who is also generally held to be the author of
the <i>Pearl</i> and of <i>Sir Gawayne</i>, and who speaks with
respect of &lsquo;Clopyngel&rsquo;s clene rose&rsquo;.</p>
<p>It is thoroughly French in all its qualities&mdash;French
of the thirteenth century, using ingeniously the ideas
and the form best suited to the readers whom it sought
to win.</p>
<p>One of the titles of the <i>Roman de la Rose</i> is the <i>Art of
Love</i>. The name is taken from a poem of Ovid&rsquo;s
which was a favourite with more than one French poet
before Guillaume de Lorris. It appealed to them
partly on account of its subject, and partly because it
was a didactic poem. It suited the common medieval
taste for exposition of doctrine, and the <i>Roman de la
Rose</i> which follows it and copies its title is a didactic
allegory. In every possible way, in its plan, its doctrine,
its sentiment, its decoration and machinery, the <i>Roman
de la Rose</i> collects all the things that had been approved
by literary tradition and conveys them, with their
freshness renewed, to its successors. It concludes one
period; it is a summary of the old French romantic
and sentimental poetry, a narrative allegory setting
forth the ideas that might be extracted from Proven&ccedil;al
lyric. Then it became a storehouse from which those
ideas were carried down to later poets, among others
to Chaucer and the Chaucerian school. Better than
anything else, the descriptive work in the <i>Roman de la
Rose</i> brings out its peculiar success as an intermediary
between earlier and later poets. The old French
romantic authors had been fond of descriptions,
particularly descriptions of pictorial subjects used as
<span class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
decoration, in painting or tapestry, for a magnificent
room. The <i>Roman de la Rose</i>, near the beginning,
describes the allegorical figures on the outside wall of
the garden, and this long and elaborate passage, of the
same kind as many earlier descriptions, became in
turn, like everything else in the book, an example for
imitation. How closely it is related to such arts as it
describes was proved in Ruskin&rsquo;s <i>Fors Clavigera</i>,
where along with his notes on the <i>Roman de la Rose</i>
are illustrations from Giotto&rsquo;s allegorical figures in the
chapel of the Arena at Padua.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;formal garden&rsquo; of the Rose is equally true,
inside the wall&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The gardin was by mesuring</p>
<p class="t0">Right even and squar in compassing.</p>
</div>
<p>The trees were set even, five fathom or six from one
another.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">In places saw I w&egrave;lles there</p>
<p class="t0">In whiche ther no frogg&egrave;s were</p>

<p class="t0">But I ne can the nombre telle</p>
<p class="t0">Of strem&egrave;s smale that by device</p>
<p class="t0">Mirth had done com&egrave; through coundys,</p>

</div>
<p>The dreamer finds Sir Mirth and a company of fair
folk and fresh, dancing a <i>carole</i>.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">This folk of which I telle you so</p>
<p class="t0">Upon a carole wenten tho;</p>
<p class="t0">A lady caroled hem, that highte</p>

<p class="t0">Non half so wel and semely,</p>
<p class="t0">And make in song swich refreininge</p>
<p class="t0">It sat her wonder wel to singe.</p>
</div>
<p>The dream, the May morning, the garden, the fair
company, the carole all were repeated for three hundred
years by poets of every degree, who drew from the
<i>Romaunt of the Rose</i> unsparingly, as from a perennial
fountain. The writers whom one would expect to
be impatient with all things conventional, Chaucer and
Sir David Lyndsay, give no sign that the May of the
old French poet has lost its charm for them; though
each on one occasion, Chaucer in the <i>Hous of Fame</i>
and Lyndsay in the <i>Dreme</i>, with a definite purpose
changes the time to winter. With both, the May
comes back again, in the <i>Legend of Good Women</i> and
in the <i>Monarchy</i>.</p>
<p>Even Petrarch, the first of the moderns to think
contemptuously of the Middle Ages, uses the form of
the Dream in his <i>Trionfi</i>&mdash;he lies down and sleeps on
the grass at Vaucluse, and the vision follows, of the
Triumph of Love.</p>
<p>The <i>Pearl</i>, one of the most beautiful of the English
medieval poems, is an allegory which begins in this
same way; the <i>Vision of Piers Plowman</i> is another.
Neither of these has otherwise much likeness to the
<i>Rose</i>; it was by Chaucer and his school that the
authority of the <i>Rose</i> was established. The <i>Pearl</i>
and <i>Piers Plowman</i> are original works, each differing
very considerably from the French style which was
adopted by Chaucer and Gower.</p>
<p>The <i>Pearl</i> is written in a lyrical stanza, or rather in
<span class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
groups of stanzas linked to one another by their
refrains; the measure is unlike French verse. The
poem itself, which in many details resembles many
other things, is altogether quite distinct from anything
else, and indescribable except to those who
have read it. Its resemblance to the <i>Paradiso</i> of
Dante is that which is less misleading than any other
comparison. In the English poem, the dreamer is
instructed as to the things of heaven by his daughter
Marjory, the Pearl that he had lost, who appears to
him walking by the river of Paradise and shows him
the New Jerusalem; like Dante&rsquo;s Beatrice at the end
she is caught away from his side to her place in glory.</p>
<p>But it is not so much in these circumstances that
the likeness is to be found&mdash;it is in the fervour, the
belief, which carries everything with it in the argument,
and turns theology into imagination. As with Dante,
allegory is a right name, but also an insufficient name
for the mode of thought in this poem.</p>
<p>In the <i>Pearl</i> there is one quite distinct and abstract
theory which the poem is intended to prove; a point
of theology (possibly heretical): that all the souls of
the blessed are equal in happiness; each one is queen
or king. In <i>Sir Gawayne</i>, which is probably by the
same author, there is the same kind of definite thought,
never lost or confused in the details. <i>Piers Plowman</i>,
on the other hand, though there are a number of
definite things which the author wishes to enforce,
is wholly different in method. The method often
seems as if it were nothing at all but random association
of ideas. The whole world is in the author&rsquo;s mind,
experience, history, doctrine, the estates and fortunes of
<span class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
mankind, &lsquo;the mirror of middle-earth&rsquo;; all the various
elements are turned and tossed about, scenes from
Bartholomew Fair mixed up with preaching or philosophy.
There is the same variety, it may be said,
in <i>The Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress</i>. But there is not the same
confusion. With Bunyan, whatever the conversation
may be, there is always the map of the road quite clear.
You know where you are; and if ever the talk is
abstract it is the talk of people who eat and drink and
wear clothes&mdash;real men, as one is accustomed to call
them. In <i>Piers Plowman</i> there is as much knowledge
of life as in Bunyan; but the visible world is seen only
from time to time. It is not merely that some part of
the book is comic description and some of it serious
discourse, but the form of thought shifts in a baffling
way from the pictorial to the abstract. It is tedious
to be told of a brook named &lsquo;Be buxom of speech&rsquo;, and
a croft called &lsquo;Covet not men&rsquo;s cattle nor their wives&rsquo;,
when nothing is made of the brook or the croft by
way of scenery; the pictorial words add nothing to the
moral meaning; if the Ten Commandments are to
be turned into allegory, something more is wanted
than the mere tacking on to them of a figurative name.
The author of <i>Piers Plowman</i> is too careless, and uses
too often a mechanical form of allegory which is little
better than verbiage.</p>
<p>But there is more than enough to make up for that,
both in the comic scenes like the Confession of the
Seven Deadly Sins, and in the sustained passages of
reasoning, like the argument about the righteous
heathen and the hopes allowable to Saracens and
Jews. The Seven Sins are not abstractions nor
<span class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
grotesque allegories; they are vulgar comic personages
such as might have appeared in a comedy or a novel
of low life, in London taverns or country inns, figures
of tradesmen and commercial travellers, speaking the
vulgar tongue, natural, stupid, ordinary people.</p>
<p>Also there is beauty; the poem is not to be dismissed
as a long religious argument with comic interludes,
though such a description would be true enough, as
far as it goes. The author is no great artist, for he
lets his meaning overpower him and hurry him, and
interrupt his pictures and his story. But he is a poet,
for all that, and he proves his gift from the outset of
his work &lsquo;in a May morning, on Malvern hilles&rsquo;;
and with all his digressions and seemingly random
thought the argument is held together and moves
harmoniously in its large spaces. The secret of its
construction is revealed in the long triumphant
passage which renders afresh the story of the Harrowing
of Hell, and in the transition to what follows, down
to the end of the poem. The author has worked up
to a climax in what may be called his drama of the
Harrowing of Hell. This is given fully, and with a
sense of its greatness, from the beginning when the
voice and the light together break in upon the darkness
of Hell and on the &lsquo;Dukes of that dim place&rsquo;&mdash;<i>Attollite
portas</i>: &lsquo;be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors&rsquo;. After
the triumph, the dreamer awakes and hears the bells
on Easter morning&mdash;</p>

</div>
<p>The end is far off; Antichrist is to come; Old Age and
Death have their triumph likewise. The poem does
not close with a solution of all problems, but with a
new beginning; Conscience setting out on a pilgrimage.
The poet has not gone wrong in his argument; the
world is as bad as ever it was, and it is thus that he
ends, after scenes of ruin that make one think of the
Twilight of the Gods, and of the courage which the
Northern heroes opposed to it.</p>
<p>It is not by accident that the story is shaped in this
way. The construction is what the writer wished it
to be, and his meaning is expressed with no failure in
coherence. His mind is never satisfied; least of all
with such conclusions as would make him forget the
distresses of human life. He is like Blake saying&mdash;</p>

<p class="t0">I will not cease from mental fight</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</div>
<p>The book of <i>Piers Plowman</i> is found in many
manuscripts which were classified by Mr. Skeat in his
edition of the poem as representing three versions,
made at different times by the author who twice
revised his book, so that there is an earlier and a later
revised and expanded version besides the first. This
theory of the authorship is not accepted by every one,
and attempts have been made to distinguish different
hands, and more particularly to separate the authorship
of the first from the second version. Those who wish
to multiply the authors have to consider, among other
things, the tone of thought in the poem; it is hard to
believe that there were two authors in the same reign
who had the same strong and weak points, the same
inconsistencies, wavering between lively imagination
and formal allegory, the same indignation and the
same tolerance. <i>Piers Plowman</i> is one of the most
impartial of all reformers. He makes heavy charges
against many ranks and orders of men, but he always
remembers the good that is to be said for them. His
remedy for the evils of the world would be to bring
the different estates&mdash;knights, clergy, labourers and
all&mdash;to understand their proper duty. His political
ideal is the commonwealth as it exists, only with each
part working as it was meant to do: the king making
the peace, with the knights to help him, the clergy
studying and praying, the commons working honestly,
and the higher estates also giving work and getting
wages. In this respect there is no inconsistency
between the earlier and the later text. In the second
version he brings in Envy as the philosophical socialist
who proves out of Plato and Seneca that all things
<span class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
should be in common. This helps to confirm what
is taught in the first version about the functions of the
different ranks. If the later versions are due to later
hands, they, at any rate, continue and amplify what is
taught in the first version, with no inconsistency.</p>

<br />SERMONS AND HISTORIES, IN VERSE AND PROSE</h2>
<p>It is one of the common difficulties in studying ancient
literature that the things preserved are not always what
we would have chosen. In modern literature, criticism
and the opinion of the reading public have
generally sorted out the books that are best worth
considering; few authors are wrongfully neglected,
and the well-known authors generally deserve their
reputation. But in literature such as that of the
thirteenth century, or the fourteenth before the time
of Chaucer, not much has been done by the opinion of
the time to sift out the good from the bad, and many
things appear in the history of literature which are
valuable only as curiosities, and some which have no
title to be called books at all. The <i>Ayenbite of Inwit</i>
is well known by name, and passes for a book; it is
really a collection of words in the Kentish dialect,
useful for philologists, especially for those who, like
the author of the book, only care for one word at a
time. The <i>Ayenbite of Inwit</i> was translated from the
French by Dan Michel of Northgate, one of the monks
of St. Augustine&rsquo;s at Canterbury, in 1340; it is
extant in his own handwriting; there is no evidence
that it was ever read by any one else. The method
of the author is to take each French word and give
the English for it; if he cannot read the French word,
or mistakes it, he puts down the English for what he
<span class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
thinks it means, keeping his eye firmly fixed on the
object, and refusing to be distracted by the other
words in the sentence. This remarkable thing has
been recorded in histories as a specimen of English
prose.</p>
<p>The <i>Ormulum</i> is another famous work which is
preserved only in the author&rsquo;s original handwriting.
It is a different thing from the <i>Ayenbite</i>; it is scholarly
in its own way, and as far as it goes it accomplishes all
that the author set out to do. As it is one of the earliest
books of the thirteenth century, it is immensely
valuable as a document; not only does it exhibit the
East Midland language of its time, in precise phonetic
spelling (the three G&rsquo;s of the <i>Ormulum</i> are now famous
in philology), but it contains a large amount of the
best ordinary medieval religious teaching; and as for
literature, its author was the first in English to use an
exact metre with unvaried number of syllables; it has
been described already. But all those merits do not
make the <i>Ormulum</i> much more than a curiosity in the
history of poetry&mdash;a very distinct and valuable sign of
certain common tastes, certain possibilities of education,
but in itself tasteless.</p>
<p>One of the generalities proved by the <i>Ormulum</i> is
the use of new metres for didactic work. The Anglo-Saxon
verse had been taken not infrequently for
didactic purposes&mdash;at one time for the paraphrase of
<i>Genesis</i>, at another for the moral emblems of the <i>Whale</i>
and the <i>Panther</i>. But the Anglo-Saxon verse was
not very well fitted for school books; it was too heavy
in diction. And there was no need for it, with Anglo-Saxon
prose established as it was. After the Norman
<span class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
Conquest, however, there was a change. Owing to
the example of the French, verse was much more
commonly used for ordinary educational purposes.
There is a great deal of this extant, and the difficulty
arises how to value it properly, and distinguish what
is a document in the history of general culture, or
morality, or religion, from what is a poem as well.</p>
<p>One of the earliest Middle English pieces is a Moral
Poem which is found in several manuscripts and
evidently was well known and popular. It is in the
same metre as the <i>Ormulum</i>, but written with more
freedom, and in rhyme. This certainly is valuable as a
document. The contents are the ordinary religion and
morality, the vanity of human wishes, the wretchedness
of the present world, the fearfulness of Hell, the
duty of every man to give up all his relations in order
to save his soul. This commonplace matter is, however,
expressed with great energy in good language and
spirited verse; the irregularity of the verse is not
helplessness, it is the English freedom which keeps the
rhythm, without always regularly observing the exact
number of syllables.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Ich am eldr&egrave; than ich was, a winter and eke on lor&egrave;,</p>
<p class="t0">Ich weld&egrave; mor&egrave; than ich dyde, my wit ought&egrave; be mor&egrave;.</p>
</div>
<p>i.e.&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">I am older than I was, in winters and also in learning;</p>
<p class="t0">I wield more than I did [I am stronger than I once was], my wit ought to be more.</p>
</div>
<p>The first line, it will be noticed, begins on the strong
syllable; the weak syllable is dropped, as it is by
Chaucer and Milton when they think fit. With this
freedom, the common metre is established as a good
<span class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
kind of verse for a variety of subjects; and the <i>Moral
Ode</i>, as it is generally called, is therefore to be respected
in the history of poetry. One vivid thing in it seems
to tell where the author came from. In the description
of the fire of Hell he says&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Ne mai hit quench&egrave; salt water, ne Avene stream ne Sture.</p>
</div>
<p>He is thinking of the rivers of Christchurch, and the
sea beyond, as Dante in Hell remembers the clear
mountain waters running down to the Arno.</p>
<p>Layamon&rsquo;s <i>Brut</i> shows how difficult it might be for
an Englishman in the reign of King John to find the
right sort of verse. The matter of the <i>Brut</i> is Geoffrey
of Monmouth&rsquo;s history, originally in Latin prose.
This had been translated into French, and of course
into rhyme, because nothing but rhyme in French
was thought a respectable form. Layamon has the
French rhyming version before him, and naturally
does not think of turning it into prose. That would
be mean, in comparison; once the historical matter
has been put into poetical form, it must not be allowed
to fall back into any form less honourable than the
French. Layamon, however, has no proper verse at
command. He knows the old English alliterative
verse, but only in the corrupt variety which is found
in some of the later Anglo-Saxon pieces, with an
increasing taste for rhyme; Layamon, of course, had
also in his head the rhymes of the French couplets
which he was translating; and the result is a most
disagreeable and discordant measure. The matter of
Layamon in many places compensates for this; much
of it, indeed, is heavy and prosaic, but some of it
<span class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
is otherwise, and the credit of the memorable passages
is at least as often due to Layamon as to the original
British history. He found the right story of the
passing of Arthur, and that makes up for much of his
uncomfortable verse and ranks him higher than the
mere educational paraphrasers.</p>
<p>The <i>Bestiary</i> and the <i>Proverbs of Alfred</i> are two
other works which resemble the <i>Brut</i> more or less
in versification, and are interesting historically. It
ought to be said, on behalf of the poorer things in this
early time, that without exception they prove a very
rich colloquial idiom and vocabulary, which might
have been used to good effect, if any one had thought
of writing novels, and which is in fact well used in
many prose sermons, and, very notably, in the long
prose book of the <i>Ancren Riwle</i>.</p>
<p>Looking at the <i>Ancren Riwle</i> and some other early
prose, one is led to think that the French influence, so
strong in every way, so distinctly making for advance
in civilization, was hurtful to the English, and a bad
example, in the literature of teaching, because the
French had nothing equal to the English prose.
French prose hardly begins till the thirteenth century;
the history of Villehardouin is contemporary with the
<i>Ancren Riwle</i>. But the English prose authors of that
time were not beginners; they had the Anglo-Saxon
prose to guide them, and they regularly follow the
tradition of &AElig;lfric. There is no break in the succession
of prose as there is between Anglo-Saxon and
Plantagenet verse; Anglo-Saxon prose did not lose
its form as the verse did, and &AElig;lfric, who was copied
by English preachers in the twelfth century, might
<span class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
have taught something of prose style to the French,
which they were only beginning to discover in the century
after. And there might have been a thirteenth-century
school of English prose, worthy of comparison
with the Icelandic school of the same time,
if the English had not been so distracted and overborne
by the French example of didactic rhyme.
French rhyme was far beyond any other model for
romance; when it is used for historical or scientific
exposition it is a poor and childish mode, incomparably
weaker than the prose of &AElig;lfric. But the example and
the authority of the French didactic rhyme proved too
strong, and English prose was neglected; so much so
that the <i>Ancren Riwle</i>, a prose book written at the
beginning of the thirteenth century, is hardly matched
even in the time of Chaucer and Wycliffe; hardly
before the date of Malory or Lord Berners.</p>
<p>The <i>Ancren Riwle</i> (the <i>Rule of Anchoresses</i>) is a
book of doctrine and advice, like many others in its
substance. What distinguishes it is the freshness and
variety of its style. It is not, like so many excellent
prose works, a translation. The writer doubtless
took his arguments where he found them, in older
books, but he thinks them over in his own way, and
arranges them; and he always has in mind the one
small household of religious ladies for whom he is
writing, their actual circumstances and the humours
of the parish. His literary and professional formulas
do not get in his way; he sees the small restricted
life as it might have appeared to a modern essayist,
and writes of it in true-bred language, the style
in which all honest historians agree. The passages
<span class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
which are best worth quoting are those which are
oftenest quoted, about the troubles of the nun who
keeps a cow; the cow strays, and is pounded; the
religious lady loses her temper, her language is furious;
then she has to beseech and implore the heyward
(parish beadle) and pay the damages after all. Wherefore
it is best for nuns to keep a cat only. But no one
quotation can do justice to the book, because the
subjects are varied, and the style also. Much of it
is conventional morality, some of it is elementary
religious instruction. There are also many passages
where the author uses his imagination, and in his
figurative description of the Seven Deadly Sins he
makes one think of the &lsquo;characters&rsquo; which were so
much in fashion in the seventeenth century; there is
the same love of conceits, though not carried quite
so far as in the later days. The picture of the Miser as
the Devil&rsquo;s own lubberly boy, raking in the ashes till
he is half blind, drawing &lsquo;figures of augrim&rsquo; in the
ashes, would need very little change to turn it into the
manner of Samuel Butler, author of <i>Hudibras</i>, in his
prose <i>Characters</i>; so likewise the comparison of the
envious and the wrathful man to the Devil&rsquo;s jugglers,
one making grotesque faces, the other playing with
knives. Elsewhere the writer uses another sort of
imagination and a different style; his description of
Christ, in a figure drawn from chivalry, is a fine
example of eloquent preaching; how fine it is, may be
proved by the imitation of it called the <i>Wooing of Our
Lord</i>, where the eloquence is pushed to an extreme.
The author of the <i>Ancren Riwle</i> felt both the attraction
and the danger of pathos; and he escaped the error of
<span class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
style into which his imitator fell; he kept to the limits
of good prose. At the same time, there is something
to be said in defence of the too poetic prose which is
exemplified in the <i>Wooing of Our Lord</i>, and in other
writings of that date. Some of it is derived from the
older alliterative forms, used in the <i>Saints&rsquo; Lives</i> of
found something
&AElig;lfric; and this, with all its faults and excesses, at
any rate kept an idea of rhythm which was generally
wanting in the alliterative verse of the thirteenth
century. It may be a wrong sort of eloquence, but it
could not be managed without a sense of rhythm or
beauty of words; it is not meagre or stinted, and it is
in some ways a relief from the prosaic verse in which
English authors copied the regular French couplets,
and the plain French diction.</p>
<p>One of the best pieces of prose about this time is a
translation from the Latin. <i>Soul&rsquo;s Ward</i> is a homily,
a religious allegory of the defence of Man&rsquo;s Soul. The
original Latin prose belongs to the mystical school of
St. Victor in Paris. The narrative part of the English
version is as good as can be; the mystical part, in the
description of Heaven and the Beatific Vision, is
memorable even when compared with the greatest
masters, and keeps its own light and virtue even when
set alongside of Plotinus or Dante. Here, as in the
<i>Ancren Riwle</i>, the figures of eloquence, rhythm and
alliteration are used temperately, and the phrasing is
wise and imaginative; not mere ornament. By one
sentence it may be recognized and remembered; where
it is told how the souls of the faithful see &lsquo;all the redes
and the runes of God, and his dooms that dern be, and
deeper than any sea-dingle&rsquo;.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</div>
<p>The greatest loss in the transition from Anglo-Saxon
to Norman and Angevin times was the discontinuance
of prose history, and the failure of the
Chronicle after the accession of Henry II. It made
a good end. The Peterborough monk who did the
reign of Stephen was much worse off for language
than his predecessors either in the time of Edward
the Elder or Edward the Confessor. His language is
what he chooses to make it, without standard or
control. But his narrative is not inferior in style to
the best of the old work, though it is weaker in spelling.
It is less restrained and more emotional than the Anglo-Saxon
history; in telling of the lawlessness under
King Stephen the writer cannot help falling into the
tone of the preachers. In the earlier Chronicle one is
never led to think about the sentiments of the writer;
the story holds the attention. But here the personal
note comes in; the author asks for sympathy. One
thinks of the cold, gloomy church, the small depressed
congregation, the lamentable tones of the sermon in
the days when &lsquo;men said openly that Christ slept and
his saints&rsquo;. With the coming of Henry of Anjou a
new order began, but the Chronicle did not go on;
the monks of Peterborough had done their best, but
there was no real chance for English prose history
when it had come to depend on one single religious
house for its continuance. The business was carried
on in Latin prose and in French rhyme; through the
example of the French, it became the fashion to use
English verse for historical narrative, and it was long
before history came back to prose.</p>
<p>Of all the rhyming historians Robert of Gloucester
<span class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
in the reign of Edward I is the most considerable by
reason of his style. Robert Manning of Brunne was
more of a literary critic; the passage in which he deals
severely with the contemporary rhyming dunces is
singularly interesting in a time when literary criticism
is rare. But Robert of Brunne is not so successful as
Robert of Gloucester, who says less about the principles
of rhyme, but discovers and uses the right kind.
This was not the short couplet. The short couplet,
the French measure, was indeed capable of almost
anything in English, and it was brilliantly used for
history by Barbour, and not meanly in the following
century by Andrew Wyntoun. But it was in danger of
monotony and flatness; for a popular audience a longer
verse was better, with more swing in it. Robert of
Gloucester took the &lsquo;common measure&rsquo;, with the
ordinary accepted licences, as it is used by the ballad
poets, and by some of the romances&mdash;for example,
in the most admirable <i>Tale of Gamelyn</i>. He turns the
history of Britain to the tune of popular minstrelsy,
and if it is not very high poetry, at any rate it moves.</p>
<p>The same kind of thing was done about the same
time with the <i>Lives of the Saints</i>&mdash;possibly some of
them by Robert of Gloucester himself. These are
found in many manuscripts, with many variations;
but they are one book, the Legend, keeping the order
of Saints&rsquo; Days in the Christian Year. This has been
edited, under the title of the <i>South English Legendary</i>,
and there are few books in which it is easier to make
acquaintance with the heart and mind of the people;
it contains all sorts of matter: church history as in the
lives of St. Dunstan, St. Thomas of Canterbury and
<span class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
St. Francis &lsquo;the Friar Minor&rsquo;; and legend, in the
common sense of the word, as in the life of St. Eustace,
or of St. Julian &lsquo;the good harbinger&rsquo;. There is the adventure
of Owen the knight in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Purgatory;
there is also the voyage of St. Brandan. In one place
there is a short rhyming treatise on natural science,
thoroughly good and sound, and in some ways very
modern. The right tone of the popular science lecture
has been discovered; and the most effective illustrations.
The earth is a globe; night is the shadow of
the earth; let us take an apple and a candle, and
everything is plain. Astronomical distances are given
in the usual good-natured manner of the lecturer who
wishes to stir but not to shock the recipient minds.
The cosmography, of course, is roughly that of Dante
and Chaucer; seven spheres beneath the eighth, which
is the sphere of the fixed stars and the highest visible
heaven. The distance to that sphere from the earth
is so great that a man walking forty miles a day could
not reach it in eight thousand years. If Adam had
started at once at that rate, and kept it up, he would
not be there yet&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Much is between heaven and earth; for the man that might&egrave; go</p>
<p class="t0">Every day forty mile, and yet some deal mo,</p>
<p class="t0">He ne shoulde nought to the highest heaven, that ye alday y-seeth</p>
<p class="t0">Comen in eighte thousand year, there as the sterren beeth:</p>
<p class="t0">And though Adam our first&egrave; father had begun anon</p>
<p class="t0">Tho that he was first y-made, and toward the heaven y-gon,</p>
<p class="t0">And had each day forty mile even upright y-go</p>
<p class="t0">He ne had nought yet to heaven y-come, by a thousand mile and mo!</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>
<p>Encyclopedias and universal histories are frequent
in rhyme. The Northern dialect comes into literary
use early in the fourteenth century in a long book, the
<i>Cursor Mundi</i> or <i>Cursor o Werld</i>, which is one of the
best of its kind, getting fairly over the hazards of
the short couplet. In the Northern dialect this type of
book comes to an end two hundred years later; the
<i>Monarchy</i> of Sir David Lyndsay is the last of its race,
a dialogue between Experience and a Courtier, containing
a universal history in the same octosyllabic
verse as the <i>Cursor Mundi</i>. The Middle Ages may be
dated as far down as this; it is a curiously old-fashioned
and hackneyed form to be used by an author so original
as Lyndsay, but he found it convenient for his anti-clerical
satire. And it may be observed that generally
the didactic literature of the Middle Ages varies
enormously not only as between one author and
another, but in different parts of the same work;
nothing (except, perhaps, the <i>Tale of Melibeus</i>) is
absolutely conventional repetition; passages of real
life may occur at any moment.</p>
<p>The <i>Cursor Mundi</i> is closely related to the Northern
groups of <i>Miracle Plays</i>. The dramatic scheme of the
<i>Miracle Plays</i> was like that of the comprehensive
narrative poem, intended to give the history of the
world &lsquo;from Genesis to the day of Judgement&rsquo;. It
is impossible in this book to describe the early drama,
its rise and progress; but it may be observed that its
form is generally near to the narrative, and sometimes
to the lyrical verse of the time.</p>
<p>The <i>Cursor Mundi</i> is one of a large number of works
in the Northern dialect, which in that century was
<span class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
freely used for prose and verse&mdash;particularly by Richard
Rolle of Hampole and his followers, a school whose
mysticism is in contrast to the more scholastic method
of Wycliffe. The most interesting work in the Northern
language is Barbour&rsquo;s <i>Bruce</i>. Barbour, the Scottish
contemporary of Chaucer, is not content with mere
rhyming chronicles; he has a theory of poetry, he has
both learning and ambition, which fortunately do not
interfere much with the spirit of his story.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="small">CHAPTER IX</span>
<br />CHAUCER</h2>
<p>Chaucer has sometimes been represented as a French
poet writing in English&mdash;not only a &lsquo;great translator&rsquo;
as his friend Eustache Deschamps called him, but so
thoroughly in sympathy with the ideas and the style
of French poetry that he is French in spirit even when
he is original. This opinion about Chaucer is not
the whole truth, but there is a great deal in it. Chaucer
got his early literary training from French authors;
particularly from the <i>Romance of the Rose</i>, which he
translated, and from the poets of his own time or a
little earlier: Machaut, Deschamps, Froissart, Granson.
From these authors he learned the refinements of
courtly poetry, the sentiment and the elegant phrasing
of the French school, along with a number of conventional
devices which were easier to imitate, such as the
allegorical dream in the fashion of the <i>Roman de la Rose</i>.
With Chaucer&rsquo;s poetry, we might say, English was
brought up to the level of French. For two or three
centuries English writers had been trying to be as
correct as the French, but had seldom or never quite
attained the French standard. Now the French were
equalled in their own style by an English poet. English
poetry at last comes out in the same kind of perfection
as was shown in French and Proven&ccedil;al as early as the
twelfth century, in German a little later with narrative
poets such as Wolfram von Eschenbach, the author of
<i>Parzival</i>, and lyric poets such as Walther von der
<span class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
Vogelweide. Italian was later still, but by the end
of the thirteenth century, in the poets who preceded
Dante, the Italian language proved itself at least the
equal of the French and Proven&ccedil;al, which had ripened
earlier. English was the last of the languages in
which the poetical ideal of the Middle Ages was
realized&mdash;the ideal of courtesy and grace.</p>
<p>One can see that this progress in English was determined
by some general conditions&mdash;the &lsquo;spirit of the
age&rsquo;. The native language had all along been growing
in importance, and by the time of Chaucer French was
no longer what it had been in the twelfth or thirteenth
centuries, the only language fit for a gentleman. At
the same time French literature retained its influence
and its authority in England; and the result was the
complete adaptation of the English language to the
French manner of thought and expression. The
English poetry of Gower is enough to prove that what
Chaucer did was not all due to Chaucer&rsquo;s original
genius, but was partly the product of the age and the
general circumstances and tendencies of literature
and education. Gower, a man of literary talent, and
Chaucer, a man of genius, are found at the same time,
working in the same way, with objects in common.
Chaucer shoots far ahead and enters on fields where
Gower is unable to follow him; but in a considerable
part of Chaucer&rsquo;s work he is along with Gower, equally
dependent on French authority and equally satisfied
with the French perfection. If there had been no
Chaucer, Gower would have had a respectable place
in history as the one &lsquo;correct&rsquo; English poet of the
Middle Ages, as the English culmination of that
<span class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
courtly medieval poetry which had its rise in France
and Provence two or three hundred years before. The
prize for style would have been awarded to Gower;
as it is, he deserves rather more consideration than he
has generally received in modern times. It is easy
to pass him over and to say that his correctness is flat,
his poetical art monotonous. But at the very lowest
valuation he did what no one else except Chaucer
was able to do; he wrote a large amount of verse in
perfect accordance with his own critical principles,
in such a way as to stand minute examination; and
in this he thoroughly expressed the good manners of
his time. He proved that English might compete with
the languages which had most distinguished themselves
in poetry. Chaucer did as much; and in his
earlier work he did no more than Gower.</p>
<p>The two poets together, different as they are in
genius, work in common under the same conditions
of education to gain for England the rank that had
been gained earlier by the other countries&mdash;France
and Provence, Germany and Italy. Without them,
English poetry would have possessed a number of
interesting, a number of beautiful medieval works,
but nothing quite in the pure strain of the finest
medieval art. English poetry would still have reflected
in its mirror an immense variety of life, a host of
dreams; but it would have wanted the vision of that
peculiar courteous grace in which the French excelled.
Chaucer and Gower made up what was lacking in
English medieval poetry; the Middle Ages did not
go by without a proper rendering of their finer spirit
in English verse.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<p>But a great many ages had passed before Chaucer
and Gower appeared, and considered as spokesmen for
medieval ideas they are rather belated. England never
quite made up what was lost in the time of depression,
in the century or two after the Norman Conquest.
Chaucer and Gower do something like what was done
by the authors of French romance in the twelfth
century, such as Chrestien de Troyes, the author of
<i>Enid</i>, or Beno&icirc;t de Sainte More, the author of the
<i>Romance of Troy</i>. But their writings do not alter the
fact that England had missed the first freshness of
chivalrous romance. There were two hundred years
between the old French romantic school and Chaucer.
Even the <i>Roman de la Rose</i> is a hundred years old when
Chaucer translates it. The more recent French poets
whom Chaucer translates or imitates are not of the
best medieval period. Gower, who is more medieval
than Chaucer, is a little behind his time. He is
mainly a narrative poet, and narrative poetry had been
exhausted in France; romances of adventure had been
replaced by allegories (in which the narrative was little
worth in comparison with the decoration), or, more
happily, by familiar personal poems like those in which
Froissart describes various passages in his own life.
Froissart, it is true, the contemporary of Chaucer,
wrote a long romance in verse in the old fashion; but
this is the exception that proves the rule: Froissart&rsquo;s
<i>Meliador</i> shows plainly enough that the old type of
romance was done. It is to the credit of Gower that
although he wrote in French a very long dull moralizing
poem, he still in English kept in the main to narrative.
It may have been old-fashioned, but it was a success.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<p>Gower should always be remembered along with
Chaucer; he is what Chaucer might have been without
genius and without his Italian reading, but with his
critical tact, and much of his skill in verse and diction.
The <i>Confessio Amantis</i> is monotonous, but it is not
dull. Much of it at a time is wearisome, but as it is
composed of a number of separate stories, it can be
read in bits, and ought to be so read. Taken one at
a time the clear bright little passages come out with a
meaning and a charm that may be lost when the book
is read too perseveringly.</p>
<p>The <i>Confessio Amantis</i> is one of the medieval works
in which a number of different conventions are used
together. In its design it resembles the <i>Romance of
the Rose</i>; and like the <i>Romance of the Rose</i> it belongs
to the pattern of Boethius; it is in the form of a
conversation between the poet and a divine interpreter.
As a collection of stories, all held together in one frame,
it follows the example set by <i>The Book of the Seven Wise
Masters</i>. Like the <i>Romance of the Rose</i> again it is an
encyclopaedia of the art of love. Very fortunately,
in some of the incidental passages it gets away from
conventions and authorities, and enlarges in a modern
good-tempered fashion on the vanities of the current
time. There is more wickedness in Gower than is
commonly suspected. Chaucer is not the only
ironical critic of his age; and in his satire Gower
appears to be, no less than Chaucer, independent of
French examples, using his wit about the things and
the humours which he could observe in the real life
of his own experience.</p>
<p>Chaucer&rsquo;s life as a poet has by some been divided
<span class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
into three periods called French, Italian and English.
This is not a true description, any more than that which
would make of him a French poet merely, but it may
be useful to bring out the importance of Chaucer&rsquo;s
Italian studies. Chaucer was French in his literary
education, to begin with, and in some respects he is
French to the end. His verse is always French in
pattern; he did not care for the English alliterative
verse; he probably like the English romance stanza
better than he pretended, but he uses it only in the
burlesque of <i>Sir Thopas</i>. In spite of his admiration
for the Italian poets, he never imitates their verse,
except in one short passage where he copies the <i>terza
rima</i> of Dante. He is a great reader of Italian poems
in the octave stanza, but he never uses that stanza;
it was left for the Elizabethans. He translates a sonnet
by Petrarch, but he does not follow the sonnet form.
The strength and constancy of his devotion to French
poetry is shown in the Prologue to the <i>Legend of Good
Women</i>. The <i>Legend</i> was written just before the
<i>Canterbury Tales</i>; that is to say, after what has been
called the Italian period. But the ideas in the Prologue
to the <i>Legend</i> are largely the ideas of the <i>Roman
de la Rose</i>. As for the so-called English period, in
which Chaucer is supposed to come to himself, to
escape from his tutors, to deal immediately in his own
way with the reality of English life, it is true that the
<i>Canterbury Tales</i>, especially in the Prologue and the
interludes and the comic stories, are full of observation
and original and fresh descriptive work. But they are
not better in this respect than <i>Troilus and Criseyde</i>,
which is the chief thing in Chaucer&rsquo;s Italian period.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<p>The importance of Chaucer&rsquo;s Italian reading is
beyond doubt. But it does not displace the French
masters in his affection. It adds something new to
Chaucer&rsquo;s mind; it does not change his mind with
regard to the things which he had learned to value in
French poetry.</p>
<p>When it is said that an English period came to
succeed the Italian in Chaucer&rsquo;s life, the real meaning
of this is that Chaucer was all the time working for
independence, and that, as he goes on, his original
genius strengthens and he takes more and more of
real life into his view. But there is no one period in
which he casts off his foreign masters and strikes out
absolutely for himself. Some of his greatest imaginative
work, and the most original, is done in his adaptation
of the story of Troilus from an Italian poem of
Boccaccio.</p>
<p>Chaucer represents a number of common medieval
tastes, and many of these had to be kept under control
in his poetry. One can see him again and again
tempted to indulge himself, and sometimes yielding,
but generally securing his freedom and lifting his
verse above the ordinary traditional ways. He has
the educational bent very strongly. That is shown in
his prose works. He is interested in popular philosophy
and popular science; he translates &lsquo;Boece&rsquo;,
the Consolation of Philosophy, and compiles the
Treatise on the Astrolabe for &lsquo;little Lewis my son&rsquo;.
The tale of <i>Melibeus</i> which Chaucer tells in his own
person among the Canterbury pilgrims is a translation
of a moral work which had an extraordinary reputation
not very easy to understand or appreciate now
<span class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
Chaucer took it up no doubt because it had been
recommended by authors of good standing: he translates
it from the French version by Jean de Meung.
The <i>Parson&rsquo;s Tale</i> is an adaptation from the French,
and represents the common form of good sermon
literature. Chaucer thus shared the tastes and the
aptitudes of the good ordinary man of letters. He was
under no compulsion to do hack work; he wrote those
things because he was fond of study and teaching, like
the Clerk of Oxford in the <i>Canterbury Tales</i>. The
learning shown in his poems is not pretence; it came
into his poems because he had it in his mind. How
his wit could play with his science is shown in the
<i>Hous of Fame</i>, where the eagle is allowed to give a
popular lecture on acoustics, but is prevented from
going on to astronomy. Chaucer dissembles his
interest in that subject because he knows that popular
science ought not to interfere too much with the
proper business of poetry; he also, being a humorist,
sees the comic aspect of his own didactic tastes; he
sees the comic opposition between the teacher anxious
to go on explaining and the listener not so ready to
take in more. There is another passage, in <i>Troilus</i>,
where good literary advice is given (rather in the style
of Polonius) against irrelevant scientific illustrations.
In a love-letter you must not allow your work for the
schools to appear too obviously&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Ne jompre eek no discordant thing y-fere,</p>
<p class="t0">As thus, to usen termes of physik.</p>
</div>
<p>This may be fairly interpreted as Chaucer talking to
himself. He knew that he was inclined to this sort of
<span class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
irrelevance and very apt to drag in &lsquo;termes of physik&rsquo;,
fragments of natural philosophy, where they were out
of place.</p>
<p>This was one of the things, one of the common
medieval temptations, from which he had to escape
if he was to be a master in the art of poetry. How
real the danger was can be seen in the works of some
of the Chaucerians, e.g. in Henryson&rsquo;s <i>Orpheus</i>, and
in Gawain Douglas&rsquo;s <i>Palace of Honour</i>.</p>
<p>Boethius is a teacher of a different sort from
Melibeus, and the poet need not be afraid of him.
Boethius, the master of Dante, the disciple of Plato,
is one of the medieval authors who are not disqualified
in any century; with him Chaucer does not require
to be on his guard. The <i>Consolation of Philosophy</i> may
help the poet even in the highest reach of his imagination;
so Boethius is remembered by Chaucer, as he is
by Dante, when he has to deal solemnly with the
condition of men on earth. This is not one of the
common medieval vanities from which Chaucer has
to escape.</p>
<p>Far more dangerous and more attractive than any
pedantry of the schools was the traditional convention
of the allegorical poets, the <i>Rose</i> and all the attendants
of the <i>Rose</i>. This was a danger that Chaucer could
not avoid; indeed it was his chief poetical task, at
first, to enter this dreamland and to come out of it
with the spoils of the garden, which could not be won
except by a dreamer and by full subjection to all the
enchantments of the place. It was part of Chaucer&rsquo;s
poetic vocation to comprehend and to make his own
the whole spirit and language of the <i>Roman de la Rose</i>
<span class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
and also of the French poets who had followed, in
the century between. The <i>Complaint to Pity</i> shows
how he succeeded in this; also the <i>Complaint of Mars</i>
and the poem called the <i>Complaint of Venus</i>, which
is a translation from Oton de Granson, &lsquo;the floure of
hem that maken in France&rsquo;. Chaucer had to do this,
and then he had to escape. This sort of fancy work,
a kind of musical sentiment with a mythology of
personified abstract qualities, is the least substantial
of all things&mdash;thought and argument, imagery and
utterance, all are of the finest and most impalpable.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Thus am I slayn sith that Pit&eacute; is deed:</p>
<p class="t0">Allas the day! that ever hit shulde falle!</p>
<p class="t0">What maner man dar now holde up his heed?</p>
<p class="t0">To whom shall any sorwful herte calle,</p>
<p class="t0">Now Crueltee hath cast to sleen us alle</p>
<p class="t0">In ydel hope, folk redelees of peyne?</p>
<p class="t0">Sith she is deed, to whom shul we compleyne</p>
</div>
<p>If this sort of verse had not been written, English
poetry would have missed one of the graces of medieval
art&mdash;a grace which at this day it is easy to despise. It
is not despicable, but neither is it the kind of beauty
with which a strong imagination can be content, or
indeed any mind whatsoever, apart from such a tradition
as that of the old &lsquo;courtly makers&rsquo;. And it is
worth remembering that not every one of the courtly
makers restricted himself to this thin, fine abstract
melody. Eustache Deschamps, for example, amused
himself with humorous verse as well; and for Froissart
his ballades and virelais were only a game, an occasional
relief from the memoirs in which he was telling the
story of his time. Chaucer in fact did very little in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
French style of abstract sentiment. The longest of
his early poems, <i>The Book of the Duchess</i>, has much of
this quality in it, but this does not make the poem.
<i>The Book of the Duchess</i> is not abstract. It uses the
traditional manner&mdash;dream, mythology, and all&mdash;but
it has other substance in it, and that is the character
of the Duchess Blanche herself, and the grief for her
death. Chaucer is here dealing with real life, and the
conventional aids to poetry are left behind.</p>
<p>How necessary it was to get beyond this French
school is shown by the later history of the French
school itself. There was no one like Chaucer in
France; except perhaps Froissart, who certainly had
plenty of real life in his memoirs. But Froissart&rsquo;s
Chronicles were in prose, and did nothing to cure the
inanition of French poetry, which went on getting
worse and worse, so that even a poetic genius like
Villon suffered from it, having no examples to guide
him except the thin ballades and rondeaux on the
hackneyed themes. R. L. Stevenson&rsquo;s account of
Charles d&rsquo;Orleans and his poetry will show well
enough what sort of work it was which was abandoned
by Chaucer, and which in the century after Chaucer
was still the most favoured kind in France.</p>
<p>It should not be forgotten that Chaucer, though he
went far beyond such poetry as that of his French
masters and of his own <i>Complaint to Pity</i>, never
turned against it. He escaped out of the allegorical
garden of the Rose, but with no resentment or ingratitude.
He never depreciates the old school. He
must have criticized it&mdash;to find it unsatisfying is to
criticize it, implicitly at any rate; but he never uses
<span class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
a word of blame or a sentence of parody. In his later
writings he takes up the devices of the Rose again;
not only in the Prologue to the <i>Legend of Good Women</i>,
but also, though less obviously, in the <i>Squire&rsquo;s Tale</i>,
where the sentiment is quite in harmony with the old
French mode.</p>
<p>Chaucer wrote no such essay on poetry as Dante <i>de
Vulgari Eloquentia</i>; not even such a practical handbook
of versification as was written by his friend
Eustache Deschamps. But his writings, like Shakespeare&rsquo;s,
have many passages referring to the literary
art&mdash;the processes of the workshop&mdash;and a comparison
of his poems with the originals which suggested
them will often bring out what was consciously in his
mind as he reflected on his work&mdash;as he calculated and
altered, to suit the purpose which he had before him.</p>
<p>Chaucer is one of the greatest of literary artists, and
one of the finest; so it is peculiarly interesting to
make out what he thought of different poetical kinds
and forms which came in his way through his reading
or his own practice. For this object&mdash;i.e. to bring out
Chaucer&rsquo;s aims and the way in which he criticized his
own poetry&mdash;the most valuable evidence is given by
the poem of <i>Anelida and the False Arcite</i>. This is not
only an unfinished poem&mdash;Chaucer left many things
unfinished&mdash;it is a poem which changes its purpose
as it goes on, which is written under two different
and discordant influences, and which could not possibly
be made harmonious without total reconstruction from
the beginning. It was written after Chaucer had gone
some way in his reading of the Italian poets, and the
opening part is copied from the <i>Teseide</i> of Boccaccio,
<span class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
which is also the original of the <i>Knight&rsquo;s Tale</i>. Now
it was principally through Boccaccio&rsquo;s example that
Chaucer learned how to break away from the French
school. Yet here in this poem of <i>Anelida</i>, starting
with imitation of Boccaccio, Chaucer goes back to the
French manner, and works out a theme of the French
school&mdash;and then drops it, in the middle of a sentence.
He was distracted at that time, it is clear, between two
opposite kinds of poetry. His <i>Anelida</i> is experimental
work; in it we can see how he was changing his mind,
and what difficulty he had with the new problems
that were offered to him in his Italian books. He
found in Italian a stronger kind of narrative than he
had been accustomed to, outside of the Latin poets;
a new kind of ambition, an attempt to rival the classical
authors in a modern language. The <i>Teseide</i> (the
<i>Theseid</i>) of Boccaccio is a modern epic poem in twelve
books, meant by its author to be strong and solid and
full; Chaucer in <i>Anelida</i> begins to translate and adapt
this heroic poem&mdash;and then he turns away from the
wars of Theseus to a story of disappointed love;
further, he leaves the narrative style and composes for
Anelida the most elaborate of all his lyric poems, the
most extreme contrast to the heavy epic manner in
which his poem is begun. The lyrical complaint of
Anelida is the perfection of everything that had been
tried in the French school&mdash;a fine unsubstantial beauty
so thin and clear that it is hardly comprehensible at
first, and never in agreement with the forcible narrative
verse at the beginning of the poem.</p>
<p>Chaucer here has been caught escaping from the
Garden of the Rose; he has heard outside the stronger
<span class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
music of the new Italian epic poetry, but the old
devotion is for the time too strong, and he falls back.
His return is not exactly failure, because the complaint
of Anelida, which is in many respects old-fashioned, a
kind of poetry very near exhaustion, is also one of the
most elaborate things ever composed by Chaucer, such
a proof of his skill in verse as he never gives elsewhere.</p>
<p>The <i>Teseide</i> kept him from sleeping, and his later
progress cannot be understood apart from this epic of
Boccaccio. When Chaucer read the Italian poets, he
found them working with a new conception of the art
of poetry, and particularly a fresh comprehension of
the Ancients. The classical Renaissance has begun.</p>
<p>The influence of the Latin poets had been strong all
through the Middle Ages. In its lowest degree it
helped the medieval poets to find matter for their
stories; the French <i>Roman d&rsquo;Eneas</i> is the work that
shows this best, because it is a version of the greatest
Latin poem, and can be easily compared with its
original, so as to find out what is understood and what
is missed or travestied; how far the scope of the <i>Aeneid</i>
is different from the old French order of romance.</p>
<p>But neither here nor generally elsewhere is the debt
limited to the matter of the stories. The sentiment,
the pathos, the eloquence of medieval French poetry
is derived from Virgil and Ovid. The Latin poets are
the originals of medieval romance, far beyond what
can be reckoned by any comparison of plots and
incidents. And the medieval poets in their turn are
the ancestors of the Renaissance and show the way to
modern poetry.</p>
<p>But the old French poets, though they did much for
<span class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
the classical education of Europe, were inattentive to
many things in classical poetry which the Italians
were the first to understand, even before the revival of
Greek, and which they appropriated for modern verse
in time for Chaucer to be interested in what they were
doing. Shortly, they understood what was meant by
composition, proportion, the narrative unities; they
appreciated the style of Latin poetry as the French did
not; in poetical ornament they learned from Virgil
something more spiritual and more imaginative than
the French had known, and for which the term
&lsquo;ornament&rsquo; is hardly good enough; it is found in the
similes of Dante, and after him in Chaucer.</p>
<p>This is one of the most difficult and one of the most
interesting parts of literary history&mdash;the culmination
and the end of the Middle Ages, in which the principles
of medieval poetry are partly justified and partly
refuted. As seen in the work of Chaucer, the effect
of this new age and the Italian poetry was partly
the stronger and richer poetical language and (an
obvious sign of this strengthening) the similes such as
were used by the classical authors. But far more than
this, a change was made in the whole manner of devising
and shaping a story. This change was suggested
by the Italian poets; it fell in with the change in
Chaucer&rsquo;s own mind and with the independent growth
of his strength. What he learned as a critic from
study he used as an artist at the time when his imaginative
power was quickest and most fertile. Yet before
his journey to Italy, and apparently before he had learnt
any Italian, he had already gone some way to meet the
new poetry, without knowing it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>
<p>His earlier narrative poems, afterwards used for the
tales of the Second Nun, the Clerk of Oxford and the
Man of Law, have at least one quality in which they
agree both with the Italians and with Chaucer&rsquo;s
maturest work. The verse is stately, strong, <i>heroic</i> in
more senses than one. Chaucer&rsquo;s employment of the
ten-syllable line in the seven-line stanza for narrative
was his own discovery. The decasyllabic line was an
old measure; so was the seven-line stanza, both in
Proven&ccedil;al and French. But the stanza had been
generally restricted to lyric poetry, as in Chaucer&rsquo;s
<i>Complaint to Pity</i>. It was a favourite stanza for
ballades. French poetry discouraged the stanza in
narrative verse; the common form for narrative of all
sorts, and for preaching and satire as well, was the
short couplet&mdash;the verse of the <i>Roman de Troie</i>, the
<i>Roman de Renart</i>, the <i>Roman de la Rose</i>, the verse of
the <i>Book of the Duchess</i> and the <i>Hous of Fame</i>. When
Chaucer used the longer verse in his <i>Life of St. Cecilia</i>
and the other earlier tales, it is probable that he was
following a common English opinion and taste, which
tended against the universal dominion of the short
couplet. &lsquo;Short verse&rsquo; was never put out of use or
favour, never insulted or condemned. But the English
seem to have felt that it was not enough; they wanted
more varieties. They had the alliterative verse, and,
again, the use of the <i>rime cou&eacute;e</i>&mdash;<i>Sir Thopas</i> verse&mdash;was
certainly due to a wish for variety. The long
verse of Robert of Gloucester was another possibility,
frequently taken. After Chaucer&rsquo;s time, and seemingly
independent of him, there were, in the fifteenth
century, still more varieties in use among the minstrels.
<span class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
There was a general feeling among poets of all degrees
that the short couplet (with no disrespect to it) was
not the only and was not the most powerful of instruments.
The technical originality of Chaucer was,
first, that he learned the secret of the ten-syllable line,
and later that he used it for regular narrative and made
it the proper heroic verse in English. The most
remarkable thing in this discovery is that Chaucer
began to conform to the Italian rule before he knew
anything about it. Not only are his single lines much
nearer to the Italian rhythm than the French. This is
curious, but it is not exceptional; it is what happens
generally when the French decasyllable is imitated in
one of the Teutonic languages, and Gower, who knew
no Italian, or at any rate shows no sign of attending to
Italian poetry, writes his occasional decasyllabic lines
in the same way as Chaucer. But besides this mode
of the single verse Chaucer agrees with the Italian
practice in using stanzas for long narrative poetry;
here he seems to have been led instinctively, or at
least without any conscious imitation, to agree with
the poet whom he was to follow still further, when once
Boccaccio came in sight. This coincidence of taste
in metre was one thing that must have struck Chaucer
as soon as he opened an Italian book. Dante and
Boccaccio used the same type of line as Chaucer had
taken for many poems before ever he learned Italian;
while the octave stanzas of Boccaccio&rsquo;s epic&mdash;the
common verse, before that, of the Italian minstrels
in their romances&mdash;must have seemed to Chaucer
remarkably like his own stanza in the <i>Life of St.
Cecilia</i> or the story of <i>Constance</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</div>
<p>This explains how it was that Chaucer, with all his
admiration for Italian poetry, never, except in one
small instance, tries to copy any Italian verse. He did
not copy the Italian line because he had the same line
already from another source; and he did not copy
Boccaccio&rsquo;s octave stanza because he had already
another stanza quite as good, if not better, in the same
kind. One need not consider long, what is also very
very probable, that Chaucer felt the danger of too
great attraction to those wonderful new models; he
would learn what he could (so he seems to have thought
to himself), but he would not give up what he had
already gained without them. Possibly the odd change
of key, the relapse from Italian to French style in
<i>Anelida</i>, might be explained as Chaucer&rsquo;s reaction
against the too overpowering influence of the new
Italian school. &lsquo;Here is this brand-new epic starting
out to conquer all the world; no question but that
it is triumphant, glorious, successful; and we cannot
escape; but before we join in the procession, and it is
too late to draw back, suppose we draw back <i>now</i>&mdash;into
the old garden&mdash;to try once more what may be
made of the old French kind of music&rsquo;. So possibly
we might translate into ruder terms what seems to be
the artistic movement in this remarkable failure by
Chaucer.</p>
<p>Chaucer spent a long time thinking over the Italian
poetry which he had learned, and he made different
attempts to turn it to profit in English before he
succeeded. One of his first complete poems after
his Italian studies had begun is as significant as
<i>Anelida</i> both with respect to the difficulties that he
<span class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
found and also to the enduring influence of the French
school. In the <i>Parliament of Birds</i>, his style as far
as it can be tested in single passages seems to have
learned everything there was to be learned&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Through me men goon into the blisful place</p>
<p class="t0">Of hert&egrave;s hele and dedly wound&egrave;s cure;</p>
<p class="t0">Through me men goon unto the welle of Grace,</p>
<p class="t0">There grene and lusty May shal ever endure;</p>
<p class="t0">This is the way to all good aventure;</p>
<p class="t0">Be glad, thou reader, and thy sorrow offcaste!</p>
<p class="t0">All open am I; passe in and hy thee faste!</p>
</div>
<p>And, as for composition, the poem carries out to the
full what the author intends; the digressions and the
slackness that are felt to detract from the <i>Book of the
Duchess</i> have been avoided; the poem expresses the
mind of Chaucer, both through the music of its solemn
verse, and through the comic dialogue of the birds in
their assembly. But this accomplished piece of work,
with all its reminiscences of Dante and Boccaccio, is
old French in its scheme; it is another of the allegorical
dreams, and the device of the Parliament of Birds is in
French older than the <i>Romaunt of the Rose</i>.</p>
<p>Chaucer is still, apparently, holding back; practising
on the ground familiar to him, and gradually working
into his poetry all that he can readily manage out of his
Italian books. In <i>Anelida</i> Italian and French are
separate and discordant; in the <i>Parliament of Birds</i>
there is a harmony, but as yet Chaucer has not matched
himself thoroughly against Boccaccio. When he
does so, in <i>Troilus</i> and in the <i>Knight&rsquo;s Tale</i>, it will be
found that he is something more than a translator,
<span class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
and more than an adapter of minor and separable
passages.</p>
<p>The <i>Teseide</i> of Boccaccio is at last after many
attempts&mdash;how many, it is impossible to say&mdash;rendered
into English by Chaucer, not in a translation, but with
a thorough recasting of the whole story. <i>Troilus and
Criseyde</i> is taken from another poem by Boccaccio.
<i>Troilus</i> and the <i>Knight&rsquo;s Tale</i> are without rivals in
English for the critical keenness which has gone into
them. Shakespeare has the same skill in dealing with
his materials, in choosing and rejecting, but Shakespeare
was never matched, as Chaucer was in these works,
against an author of his own class, an author, too, who
had all the advantages of long training. The interest&mdash;the
historical interest at any rate&mdash;of Chaucer&rsquo;s dealings
with Boccaccio is that it was an encounter between an
Englishman whose education had been chiefly French,
and an Italian who had begun upon the ways of the
new learning. To put it bluntly, it was the Middle
Ages against the Renaissance; and the Englishman
won on the Italian ground and under the Italian rules.
Chaucer judged more truly than Boccaccio what the
story of Palamon and Arcite was worth; the story of
Troilus took shape in his imagination with incomparably
more strength and substance. In both cases
he takes what he thinks fit; he learned from Boccaccio,
or perhaps it would be truer to say he found out for
himself in reading Boccaccio what was the value of
right proportion in narrative. He refused altogether
to be led away as Boccaccio was by the formal classical
ideal of epic poetry&mdash;the &lsquo;receipt to make an epic
poem&rsquo; which prescribed as necessary all the things
<span class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
employed in the construction of the <i>Aeneid</i>. Boccaccio
is the first modern author who writes an epic in twelve
books; and one of his books is taken up with funeral
games, because Virgil in the <i>Aeneid</i> had imitated
the funeral games in Homer. In the time of Pope
this was still a respectable tradition. Chaucer is not
tempted; he keeps to what is essential, and in the
proportions of his story and his conception of the
narrative unities he is saner than all the Renaissance.</p>
<p>One of the finest passages in English criticism of
poetry is Dryden&rsquo;s estimate of Chaucer in the Preface
to the <i>Fables</i>. Chaucer is taken by Dryden, in the
year 1700, as an example of that sincerity and truth to
Nature which makes the essence of classical poetry.
In this classical quality, Dryden thinks that Ovid is far
inferior to Chaucer. Dryden makes allowance for
Chaucer&rsquo;s old-fashioned language, and he did not fully
understand the beauty of Chaucer&rsquo;s verse, but still
he judges him as a modern writer with respect to his
imagination; to no modern writer does he give higher
praise than to Chaucer.</p>
<p>This truth to Nature, in virtue of which Chaucer
is a classic, will be found to be limited in some of his
works by conventions which are not always easy to
understand. Among these should not be reckoned
the dream allegory. For though it may appear strange
at first that Chaucer should have gone back to this
in so late a work as the Prologue to the <i>Legend of Good
Women</i>, yet it does not prevent him from speaking his
mind either in earlier or later poems. In the <i>Book of
the Duchess</i>, the <i>Parliament of Birds</i>, the Prologue to the
<i>Legend</i>, one feels that Chaucer is dealing with life,
<span class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
and saying what he really thinks, in spite of the conventions.
The <i>Hous of Fame</i>, which is a dream poem,
might almost have been written for a wager, to show
that he could bring in everything traditional, everything
most common in the old artificial poetry, and
yet be original and fresh through it all. But there are
some stories&mdash;the <i>Clerk&rsquo;s Tale</i>, and the <i>Franklin&rsquo;s Tale</i>&mdash;in
which he uses conventions of another sort and is
partially disabled by them. These are stories of a
kind much favoured in the Middle Ages, turning each
upon one single obligation which, for the time, is
regarded as if it were the only rule of conduct. The
patience of Griselda is absolute; nothing must be
allowed to interfere with it, and there is no other moral
in the story. It is one of the frequent medieval
examples in which the author can only think of one
thing at a time. On working out this theme, Chaucer
is really tried as severely as his heroine, and his patience
is more extraordinary, because if there is anything
certain about him it is that his mind is never satisfied
with any one single aspect of any matter. Yet here
he carries the story through to the end, though when
it is finished he writes an epilogue which is a criticism
on the strained morality of the piece. The plot of the
<i>Franklin&rsquo;s Tale</i> is another of the favourite medieval
type, where the &lsquo;point of honour&rsquo;, the obligation of a
vow, is treated in the same uncompromising way;
Chaucer is here confined to a problem under strict
rules, a drama of difficulties without character.</p>
<p>In the <i>Legend of Good Women</i> he is limited in a
different way, and not so severely. He has to tell
&lsquo;the Saints&rsquo; Lives of Cupid&rsquo;&mdash;the Legends of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
Heroines who have been martyrs for love; and as in
the Legend of the Saints of the Church, the same
motives are repeated, the trials of loyalty, the grief and
pity. The Legend was left unfinished, apparently
because Chaucer was tired. Yet it is not certain that
he repented of his plan, or that the plan was wrong.
There may possibly have been in this work something
of the formalism which is common in Renaissance art,
the ambition to build up a structure in many compartments,
each compartment resembling all the others in
the character of the subject and its general lines. But
the stories are distinct, and all are beautiful&mdash;the
legends of Cleopatra Queen and Martyr, of Thisbe
and Ariadne, and the rest. Another poem which may
be compared with the <i>Legend of Good Women</i> is the
<i>Monk&rsquo;s Tale</i>&mdash;an early work to which Chaucer made
later additions&mdash;his book of the <i>Falls of Princes</i>. The
Canterbury pilgrims find it too depressing, and in
their criticism of the Monk&rsquo;s tragedies Chaucer may
possibly have been thinking also of his unfinished
<i>Legend of Good Women</i>. But what has been said of
the Legend may be repeated about the <i>Monk&rsquo;s Tale</i>;
there is the same kind of pathos in all the chapters,
but they are all varied. One of the tragedies is the
most considerable thing which Chaucer took from
Dante; the story of Ugolino in the <i>Inferno</i>, &lsquo;Hugelyn
Erle of Pise&rsquo;.</p>
<p>It is uncertain whether Chaucer knew the <i>Decameron</i>
of Boccaccio, but the art of his comic stories is very
like that of the Italian, to whom he owed so much in
other ways. It is the art of comic imagination, using
a perfect style which does not need to be compared
<span class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
with the unsophisticated old French ribaldry of the
<i>fabliaux</i> to be appreciated, though a comparison of that
sort will show how far the Middle Ages had been left
behind by Boccaccio and Chaucer. Among the interludes
in the <i>Canterbury Tales</i> there are two especially,
the monologues of the Wife of Bath and the Pardoner,
where Chaucer has discovered one of the most successful
forms of comic poetry, and the Canon&rsquo;s Yeoman&rsquo;s
prologue may be reckoned as a third along with them,
though there, and also in the <i>Canon&rsquo;s Yeoman&rsquo;s Tale</i>,
the humour is of a peculiar sort, with less character
in it, and more satire&mdash;like the curious learned satire
of which Ben Jonson was fond. It is remarkable that
the tales told by the Wife of Bath and the Pardoner
are both in a different tone from their discourses about
themselves.</p>
<p>Without <i>Troilus and Criseyde</i> the works of Chaucer
would be an immense variety&mdash;romance and sentiment,
humour and observation, expressed in poetical
language that has never been equalled for truth and
liveliness. But it is only in <i>Troilus</i> that Chaucer uses
his full powers together in harmony. All the world,
it might be said, is reflected in the various poems of
Chaucer; <i>Troilus</i> is the one poem which brings it all
into a single picture. In the history of English poetry
it is the close of the Middle Ages.</p>

<h2 id="c10"><span class="small">NOTE ON BOOKS</span></h2>
<p>For the language: Anglo-Saxon can be learned in Sweet&rsquo;s
<i>Primer</i> and <i>Reader</i> (Clarendon Press). Sweet&rsquo;s <i>First Middle
English Primer</i> gives extracts from the <i>Ancren Riwle</i> and the
<i>Ormulum</i>, with separate grammars for the two dialects. But
it is generally most convenient to learn the language of
Chaucer before attempting the earlier books. Morris and
Skeat&rsquo;s <i>Specimens of Early English</i> (two volumes, Clarendon
Press) range from the end of the English Chronicle (1153)
to Chaucer; valuable for literary history as well as philology.
The nature of the language is explained in Henry Bradley&rsquo;s
<i>Making of English</i> (Clarendon Press), and in Wyld&rsquo;s <i>Study of
the Mother Tongue</i> (Murray).</p>
<p>The following books should be noted: Stopford Brooke,
<i>Early English Literature</i> (Macmillan); Schofield, <i>English
Literature from the Norman Conquest to Chaucer</i> (Macmillan);
Jusserand, <i>Literary History of the English People</i> (Fisher
Unwin); Chambers&rsquo; <i>Cyclop&aelig;dia of English Literature</i>, I;
Ten Brink, <i>Early English Literature</i> (Bell); Saintsbury,
<i>History of English Prosody</i>, I (Macmillan); Courthope,
<i>History of English Poetry</i>, I and II (Macmillan).</p>
<p>Full bibliographies are provided in the <i>Cambridge History
of English Literature</i>.</p>
<p>The bearings of early French upon English poetry are
illustrated in Saintsbury&rsquo;s <i>Flourishing of Romance and Rise
of Allegory</i> (Blackwood). Much of the common medieval
tendencies may be learned from the earlier part of Robertson&rsquo;s
<i>German Literature</i> (Blackwood), and Gaspary&rsquo;s <i>Italian
Literature</i>, translated by Oelsner (Bell). Some topics have
been already discussed by the present author in other works:
<i>Epic and Romance</i> (Macmillan); <i>The Dark Ages</i> (Blackwood);
<i>Essays on Medieval Literature</i> (Macmillan).</p>
<p>The history of medieval drama in England, for which
there was no room in this book, is clearly given in Pollard&rsquo;s
<i>Miracle Plays, Moralities and Interludes</i> (Clarendon Press).</p>

<p class="center">By R. W. <span class="sc">Chambers</span></p>
<p><i>Many years have passed since the publication of Ker&rsquo;s
volume in the</i> Home University Library, <i>yet there is hardly
a paragraph in it which demands any serious addition or
alteration. It is a classic of English criticism, and any attempt
to alter it, or &lsquo;bring it up to date&rsquo;, either now or in future
years, would be futile</i>.</p>
<p><i>Ker deliberately refused to add an elaborate bibliography.
But his</i> Note on Books <i>reminds us how, though his own work
remains unimpaired, the whole field of study has been altered,
largely as a result of that work</i>.</p>
<p class="tb">Sweet&rsquo;s books mark an epoch in Anglo-Saxon study, and
have not lost their practical value: to his <i>Primer</i> and <i>Reader</i>
(Clarendon Press) must be added the <i>Anglo-Saxon Reader</i>
of A. J. Wyatt (Cambridge University Press, 1919, etc.).
The earlier portion of Morris&rsquo;s <i>Specimens of Early English</i>,
Part I (1150-1300), has been replaced by Joseph Hall&rsquo;s
<i>Selections from Early Middle English</i>, 1130-1250, 2 vols.
(Clarendon Press, 1920); Part II, <i>Specimens</i> (1298-1393),
edited by Morris and Skeat, has been replaced by <i>Fourteenth
Century Verse and Prose</i>, edited by Kenneth Sisam (Clarendon
Press, 1921). To Wyld&rsquo;s <i>Study of the Mother Tongue</i> must
now be added his <i>History of Modern Colloquial English</i> and
Otto Jespersen&rsquo;s <i>Growth and Structure of the English Language</i>
(Blackwell, 1938).</p>
<p><i>The Anglo-Saxon Poetic Records</i>, edited by G. P. Krapp
and others (Columbia Univ. Press and Routledge, 6 vols,
1931, etc.), provide a corpus of Anglo-Saxon poetry.</p>
<p>It is impossible to review editions of, or monographs on,
individual poems or authors, but some work done on <i>Beowulf</i>
and Chaucer may be noted: editions of <i>Beowulf</i>, by Sedgefield
(Manchester Univ. Press, 1910, etc.), by Wyatt and Chambers
(Cambridge Univ. Press, 1914, etc.) and by Klaeber (Heath
&amp; Co., 1922, etc.); R. W. Chambers, <i>Beowulf, an Introduction</i>
<span class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
(Cambridge Univ. Press, 1921, etc.), and W. W. Lawrence,
<i>Beowulf and Epic Tradition</i> (Harvard Univ. Press, 1928, etc.);
G. L. Kittredge, <i>Chaucer and his Poetry</i> (Harvard Univ.
Press, 1915); J. L. Lowes, <i>Geoffrey Chaucer</i> (Oxford Univ.
Press, 1934); F. N. Robinson, <i>The Complete Works of
Geoffrey Chaucer</i> (Oxford Univ. Press, 1933).</p>
<p>Fresh aspects of medieval literature are dealt with in
G. R. Owst&rsquo;s <i>Preaching in Medieval England</i> (Cambridge
Univ. Press, 1926) and <i>Literature and the Pulpit in Medieval
England</i> (Cambridge Univ. Press, 1933); R. W. Chambers,
<i>The Continuity of English Prose</i> (Oxford Univ. Press, 1932);
C. S. Lewis, <i>Allegory of Love</i> (Clarendon Press, 1936); Mr.
Owst&rsquo;s books serve to remind us that Ker&rsquo;s work can still
be supplemented by minute study of fields which he, with
his vast range over the literatures of all Western Europe,
had of necessity to leave unexplored, when he closed his
little book with Chaucer. The two most startling new
discoveries in Medieval English Literature fall outside the
limits which Ker set himself; they are <i>The Book of Margery
Kempe</i>, edited in 1940 for the Early English Text Society by
Prof. S. B. Meech and Miss Hope Emily Allen, and the
Winchester manuscript of Malory&rsquo;s <i>Morte Darthur</i>, upon
which Prof. Eugene Vinaver is now engaged.</p>
<p>The student will find particulars of the books he wants
by consulting the new bibliography of the <i>Cambridge History
of English Literature</i> or <i>A Manual of the Writings in Middle
English, 1050-1400</i>, by Prof. J. E. Wells (Yale and Oxford
Univ. Presses, 1916, with supplements).</p>

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
